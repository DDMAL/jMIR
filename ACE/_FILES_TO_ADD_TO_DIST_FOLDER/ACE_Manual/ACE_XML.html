<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>ACE XML is a set of file formats developed to enable communication between 
    the various jMIR software components. These file formats have been designed 
    to be very flexible and expressive, and it is hoped that they will eventually 
    be adopted beyond the limited scope of jMIR as a multi-purpose standardized 
    format by the music information retrieval (MIR) research community.</p>
  <p>Aside from ACE XML, there is currently no unified standardized general-purpose 
    format for storing specialized MIR-related information such as class ontologies, 
    feature values and ground truth labels. This has resulted in the emergence 
    of the <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html" target="top">Weka 
    ARFF</a> format as a de facto standard. Although ARFF and Weka in general 
    are powerful tools, they have not been designed with the specific needs of 
    music in mind, and thus have a number of important limitations when applied 
    to MIR research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary of Advantages of ACE XML over Weka ARFF and Other General Formats 
  with Regard to MIR Research</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As can be expected from any truly multi-purpose framework, Weka ARFF has 
    a number of limitations with respected to the particularities of music and 
    MIR. Although these problems are in no way limited only to Weka, which is 
    in general an exceptionally good system, they can perhaps best be illustrated 
    via an analysis of the Weka ARFF file format which is used to communicate 
    feature values and class labels to Weka. The following points demonstrate 
    the limitations of the Weka ARFF format that are met by ACE XML:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> There is no good way to assign more than one class to a given instance 
      in an ARFF file, something that one might often wish to do in MIR tasks 
      such as genre classification. There are awkward workarounds, such as breaking 
      one multi-class problem into many binary classification problems so that 
      there is a separate ARFF file for every class, but this is obviously a non-optimal 
      approach. ACE XML provides the ability to assign multiple classes to individual 
      instances.</li>
    <li>ARFF files do not allow any labeling or structuring of instances. Each 
      instance is stored only as a collection of feature values and a class identifier, 
      with no identifying metadata or sub-segmentations. This is problematic when 
      dealing with music where, for example, it is often appropriate to extract 
      features over a number of possibly overlapping related windows. Furthermore, 
      some features may be extracted for each window, some only for some windows 
      and some only for a recording as a whole. ARFF files provide no way of associating 
      the features of a window with the recording that it comes from, nor do they 
      provide any means of identifying recordings, storing additional metadata 
      relating to them or of storing time stamps associated with each window. 
      ACE XML, in contrast, allows all of these things.</li>
    <li>ARFF files do not permit any logical grouping of features. Each feature 
      is treated as an independent quantity with no structural relation to any 
      other features. This makes it difficult to fully capitalize on the advantages 
      offered by multi-dimensional features. ACE XML allows logical grouping of 
      features. </li>
    <li> There is no way of imposing a structure on class labels in ARFF files. 
      One often encounters hierarchical or more sophisticated ontological structures 
      in music (e.g., structural analysis or genre classification), and it can 
      be very profitable to take advantage of this using appropriately structured 
      classifier ensembles or weighted misclassification penalties during training. 
      ACE XML allows the specification of hierarchical class ontologies.</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Details of ACE XML</strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> An important priority when developing a feature file format is to enforce 
    a clear separation between the feature extraction and classification tasks, 
    as particular researchers may have reasons for using particular feature extractors 
    or particular classification systems. A successful file format should therefore 
    make it possible to use any feature extractor to communicate any features 
    of any type to any classification system. This portability makes it possible 
    to use features generated with different extractors with the same classification 
    system, or a given set of extracted features with multiple classification 
    systems.</p>
  <p> The reusability of files is another important consideration. For example, 
    it could be useful to use the same set of extracted features for a variety 
    of tasks, such as genre classification as well as artist identification. Similarly, 
    it could be convenient to reuse the same model classifications with different 
    sets of features. For example, one could classify a given corpus of audio 
    recordings and then later perform the same task on symbolic recordings of 
    the same corpus using the same model classifications. Unfortunately, most 
    current feature file formats merge feature values and model classifications, 
    making this kind of reusability difficult.</p>
  <p> The use of two separate types files was therefore adopted in ACE XML for 
    what is traditionally contained in one file, namely one file for storing feature 
    values and another for storing model classifications. Unique keys such as 
    file names can be used to merge the two files. The model classification file 
    can be omitted when using unsupervised learning or classifying unknown patterns.</p>
  <p>ACE XML also includes an additional optional file format for specifying taxonomical 
    class structures. This enables one to specify the relationships between classes, 
    information that can be very useful for tasks such as hierarchical classification. 
    This file can be omitted if only flat classification is to be used. There 
    are plans to expand ACE XML to include more general ontologies.</p>

  <p> The final optional file format included in the ACE XML specification stores 
    metadata about features, such as basic descriptions or details about the cardinality 
    of multi-dimensional features. Although not strictly necessary, such a file 
    helps solidify the potential for full independence between feature extractors 
    and classifiers. A researcher with a classifier could be e-mailed a feature 
    values file and a feature definitions file by other researchers, for example, 
    and would need no additional information about the feature extractor used 
    or the features it extracted.</p>

  <p>The explicit <a href="http://www.xmlfiles.com/dtd/" target="top">XML Document 
    Type Definitions</a> (DTD&#8217;s) of the four proposed ACE XML formats are 
    shown in Figures 1 to 4. It can be seen from Figure 1 that features may be 
    stored for overall instances, called data sets, which may or may not have 
    sub-sections. This can correspond to a recording and its windows, for example. 
    Each sub-section has its own features, and each data set may have overall 
    features as well. Each sub-section may have start and stop stamps in order 
    to indicate what portion of the data set it corresponds to. This makes it 
    possible to have windows of arbitrary and varying sizes that can overlap. 
    Each feature has a name identifying it, which makes it possible to omit features 
    from some data sets or sub-sections if appropriate. Each feature may also 
    have one or more values (denoted by the &lt;v&gt; element) in order to permit 
    multi-dimensional features.</p>

    data set may be assigned one or more overall classes as well. Each sub-section 
    is given start and stop stamps to show the region of influence of particular 
    classes.</p>

  <p> The final optional file format, for storing feature definitions, is shown

    overall data sets only and how many dimensions it has.</p>
