<p><strong>Panel Overview</strong>
<blockquote>
The File Path Settings dialog box can be used to find, store, and edit ACE configuration file paths.
These are the component files of an ACE project. This window can be accessed 
by clicking <i>Load Configuration Files</i> in the <i>File</i> menu.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Panel Contents</strong>
<blockquote>
 <p>The <i>Project file</i> field holds the path of the currently loaded
 ace_project_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this field allows it to be 
 updated.
 
 <p>The <i>Use ARFF file rather than ACE XML files</i> check box specifies
 whether or not Weka ARFF files are to be used rather than ACE 
 feature_vector_files, taxonomy_files, feature_key_files and 
 classifications_file. Selecting or deselecting this box deactivates and 
 activates the appropriate GUI elements.
 
 <p>The <i>Taxonomy file</i> field holds the path of the currently specified
 ACE taxonomy_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this field allows it to 
 be updated. This file holds the taxonomy to classify instances into.
 
 <p>The <i>Feature definitions file</i> field holds the path of the currently 
 specified ACE feature_key_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this field
 allows it to be updated. This file holds details of the features which are
 used for classification.
 
 <p>The <i>Feature vector files</i> field holds the paths of the currently
 specified ACE feature_vector_files. The <i>Add</i> button next to this field
 allows files to be added to the list, and the <i>Remove</i> button deletes 
 any currently selected files. This file holds extracted feature values for 
 instances to be classified.
 
 <p>The <i>Model classifications file</i> field holds the path of the 
 currently specified ACE classifications_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next
 to this field allows it to be updated. This file holds model classifications
 for instances. This can be used to train or test classifiers.
 
 <p>The <i>GUI preferences file</i> field holds the path of the currently 
 specified ACE gui_preferences_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this 
 field allows it to be updated. This file holds user preferences for 
 configuring the ACE interface.
 
 <p>The <i>Classifier settings file</i> field holds the path of the currently 
 specified ACE classifier_settings_file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this
 field allows it to be updated. This file holds preferences for performing 
 classifications and classifier optimization searches.
 
 <p>The <i>Weka ARFF file</i> field holds the path of the currently specified
 Weka ARFF file. The <i>Browse</i> button next to this field allows it to be 
 updated. This file is an alternative to the native ACE file formats. It can
 hold feature values of instances, model classifications and an implied flat 
 taxonomy.
 
 <p>The <i>Start New Project</i> button  Brings up a dialog box that allows
 the user to choose the name of a new ACE project file and where to save it.
 The user is asked if s/he would like to copy the files referred to by the 
 existing GUI fields to the new project directory. If so, they are copied to a
 new subdirectory with the same name as the project file.
 
 <p>The <i>Save This Project</i> button saves the paths displayed in the GUI 
 fields to the path specified in the <i>Project file</i> field. If this field
 is empty, then the user is presented with a <i>Start New Project</i> dialog
 box.
 
 <p>The <i>Save As Startup Defaults</i> button stores the paths currently 
 entered in the dialog box to disk so that they will be the defaults loaded
 when the ACE GUI is next run.
 
 <p>The <i>Cancel</i> button cancels all changes made in this dialog box,
 restores previously stored entries to the fields and hides this dialog box.
 
 <p>The <i>Clear Paths</i> button clears all GUI fields in this dialog box.
 
 <p>The <i>OK</i> button stores all changes made in this dialog box  and hides
 this dialog box.
