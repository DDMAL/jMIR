<feature_key_file>

   <comments>This is an example of an XML file that stores abstract data about
   features. The name element specifies the unique name of a feature. The
   optional description element can be used to include arbitrary descriptions or
   other metadata about features. The is_sequential element specifies whether or
   not the feature can be extracted from sub-sections of an instance. A value of
   true means that it can, and a value of false means that the feature can only
   be extracted from instances as a whole, not from their sub-sections. The
   parallel_dimensions element specifies the dimensionality of extracted vectors
   of the feature. This value will be 1 unless the feature is a multi-
   dimensional feature.</comments>
