<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<blockquote>
<p>The Feature Definitions Panel represents the contents of an ACE XML feature definitions file. 
This panel allows users to view, edit, load and save feature definitions. This information relates
to features themselves, not to actual feature values extracted from features. The <i>Instances 
Panel</i> should be consulted if one wishes to view
extracted feature values.</p>
<p>The features are displayed in table form. This table may be sorted based
 on the contents of a given column by clicking on the appropriate column
 heading. The contents of any row may be changed by double clicking on any
 entry on the table (or clicking once, in the case of check boxes). Columns
 may also be reordered by dragging their headings. All features must have
 unique names and must have at least 1 dimension. Any attempt to enter invalid
 entries will be rejected by the system.</p>

<p><strong>Panel Contents</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Name</i> column specifies the name of a feature. The
 <i>Dimensions</i> column indicates the number of separate values that are
 stored each time the given feature is extracted. The <i>Sequential</i> column
 specifies whether a feature can be applied to sub-section of a data set (e.g.
 a window of audio). A value of true means that it can, and a value of false
 means that the feature may only be extracted once per data set. The
 <i>Description</i> column provides a brief description of each feature.
 
 <p>The status bar displays the total number of loaded feature definitions,
 including information on how many of them are multi-dimensional and how many
 of them are sequential.
 
 <p>The <i>View Descriptions</i> button causes the descriptions of each
 feature selected on the table to be displayed in a separate dialog box.
 
 <p>The <i>Add Feature</i> button causes a new feature to be added to the end
 of the table. It is given a unique name.
 
 <p>The <i>Delete Features</i> button causes all selected features to be
 deleted from the table.
 
 <p>The <i>Load Features</i> button loads a feature_key_file ACE XML file into
 memory and displays it. This overwrites any existing feature definitions.
 
 <p>The <i>Save Features</i> button saves the currently loaded feature
 definitions into the path referred to in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog
 box as a feature_key_file ACE XML file. The <i>Save As</i> button allows the
 user to choose the path to  which the file is to be saved and updates the
 path in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog box.
