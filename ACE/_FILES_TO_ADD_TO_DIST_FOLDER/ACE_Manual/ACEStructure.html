<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The structure of ACE is designed such that all possible sources can access ACE in the
same way; ACE's functionality is independent of the source that calls it. Code is divided 
based on the processing that it performs (code that trains is in a class called Trainer, code 
that classifies is in a class called InstanceClassifier, etc). Classes found in the ace.datatypes
package are storage objects used for communication between the main processing classes. The main processing classes 
and datatypes that can be used by the graphic user interface, the command 
line interface, or external APIs are described below. </blockquote>
<p><strong>Main Processing Classes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Coordinator - The class through which all sources can access ACE's training, classification, 
    cross validation, and experimentation functionality. 
	The following classes are intended to only be called by Coordinator. All other sources 
	need only call the appropriate methods in Coordinator. Loading and preparation of 
	instances as well as dimensionality reduction is performed in this class prior to 
	passing instances to processing classes.	
	<li>Trainer - Trains the specified type of Weka Classifier based on the given training
	instances. The trained Classifier is stored and saved in a TrainedModel object. 
	<li>InstanceClassifier - Classifies a set of instances using a trained Weka Classifier. 
	This class reads the TrainedModel object from the specified file and uses it to classify
	the given instances. The classifications are stored and returned in an array of 
	SegmentedClassification objects. In the context of cross validation, a classified
	Instances object is returned. Classifications can be written to a Weka ARFF file or an ACE XML
	classifications file (depending on which format was used to load the initial instances).
	<li>CrossValidator - Cross validates the given instances with the specified type of
	Weka Classifier and the specified number of folds. Instances are partitioned randomly
	into training and testing data for each fold (note that the original order of instances 
	remains the same, the random assignment affect only whether an instance is used for training
	or testing in any one fold). CrossValidator makes calls to the Trainer
	and InstanceClassifier classes to evaluate the performance of a specific classification
	approach. The specified type of Weka Classifier is trained on the training data and tested 
	on the testing data for each fold. Statistics are stored for each fold and used to calculate 
	average statistics to represent the overall success of the classification approach being tested.
	<li>Experimenter - Finds the best classification approach by making repeated calls to
	the CrossValidator class. Different types of Classifiers are tested with multiple types
	of dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is performed first. Experimenter 
	calls DimensionalityReducer to get an array of Instances objects, each cell containing 
	a different dimensionality reduced version of the original instances. Each type of Classifier
	is cross validated with each set of dimensionality reduced instances. Results are saved
	in multiple files. One file will be created for each set of dimensionality reduced instances.
	A summary of the results for each cross validation for each dimensionality reduction 
	will be written in the file for the corresponding set of instances. The results for the
	best found Classifier for each dimensionality reduction are printed at the beginning of 
	printed at the beginning of each file. The best classification overall is chosen by comparing
	the best results for each dimensionality reduction. A copy of the results summary for the
	best found classification approach will be written in a separate "best results overall" 
	file. After the best classification has been chosen, validation is performed using a 
	publication set that was set aside at the beginning of the experiment. A new Classifier
	of the chosen type is created and trained on the chosen type of dimensionality reduced
	instances (all instances are included except for the publication set). The newly trained
	Classifier is tested on the publication set and results are saved to the "best results
	overall" file.
	<li>DimensionalityReducer - Reduces the dimensionality of a set of instances. This class
	is called by the Coordinator class to reduce the dimensionality of the training data
	prior to training and cross validating. This class is also called by the Experimenter 
	class to create an array of multiple dimensionality reduced versions of an original set
	of instances. 
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ACE Datatypes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>DataSet - Stores the feature values for a set of instances. This datatype is similar
	to the Weka Instances object. This object corresponds to the ACE XML feature vectors file.
	<li>FeatureDefinition - Stores the possible features for which the instances of this ACE
	project could have values. This object corresponds to the ACE XML feature definitions file.
	
	<li>SegmentedClassification - Stores the classifications for a set of instances. This
	object corresponds to the ACE XML model classifications file.
	<li>Taxonomy - Stores the hierarchy of the classes into which an instance of this project
	may be classified.
	<li>DataBoard - Holds reference to the main ACE datatypes (Taxonomy, DataSet, Feature
	Definition, SegmentedClassifiation). Constructors of this class enable the creation of these
	main ACE datatypes from either ACE XML files or Weka ARFF files.
	<li>Project - Holds reference to the paths to each of the component ACE XML files of an
	ACE project. This object is associated with the ACE XML project file. This class contains
	methods for loading, parsing, and saving an ACE project file.
	<li>TrainedModel - Serializable object that stores the Weka Objects associated with a 
	Classification. Trainer will train the Weka Classifier, set the fields of this class, and 
	save it to a file. InstanceClassifier will read this object from a file and access its 
	fields to be used for classification. This object contains reference to a Weka Classifier,
	a Weka AttributeSelection, and a Weka Attribute object describing the possible classes 
	to which an Instance may belong.
	<li>CrossValidationResults - Holds the results of a cross validation. Statistics like error
	rate, standard deviation of error rates, and confusion matrix can be accessed through the
	public fields of this class. In experimentation, a 2D array of these objects is used to
	store the results for each classifier and each dimensionality reduction.
</ul>
