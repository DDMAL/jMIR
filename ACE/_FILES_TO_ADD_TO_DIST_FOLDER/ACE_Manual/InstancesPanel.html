<p><strong>Panel Overview</strong>
<blockquote>
This panel displays feature values and model classifications. Both ACE XML feature vectors files and 
ACE XML model classifications files are displayed simultaneously in this one panel. One row of the 
instances table contains both information about the feature value and the model classification for
that instance. This panel allows users to view, edit, load and save the classifications and feature 
values of a data set. This information relates to the actual feature values, not the features themselves.
<p>The instances are displayed in table form. The contents of any row may be changed by double 
clicking on any entry on the table (or clicking once, in the case of check boxes). Columns
may also be reordered by dragging their headings. All instances must have
unique identifiers and must have at least 1 dimension. Any attempt to enter invalid
entries will be rejected by the system. If feature vectors and classifications 
are loaded for the same instance, the data will be merged into one row. By 
default, feature values and miscellaneous information is not displayed. The 
checkboxes <i>Display Feature Values</i> and <i>Show Misc Info</i> must be 
selected for this information to be displayed.

<p><strong>Panel Contents</strong>
<blockquote>
<p>If a data set with subsections has been loaded, the <i>Show Subsections</i> column will contain 
checkboxes for each instance that has subsections that, when selected, will display all of the sub-sections
of that instance.
 The <i>identifier</i> column specifies the unique name of a instance. The
 <i>Start</i> column indicates the point in time (in seconds) that a subsection of an instance begins. The <i>Stop</i> column
 specifies the point in time (in seconds) that a subsection of an instance ends. The
 <i>Classes</i> column should only displayed if an ACE XML classifications file has been loaded and will display the given classification(s) for each instance.
 
 <p>The status bar displays the total number of loaded feature vectors and the total number of loaded classifications.
 
 <p>The <i>Display Feature Values</i> button causes the feature values columns to become visible.
 
 <p>The <i>Show Misc Info</i> button causes columns containing miscellaneous information to become visible.
 
 <p>The <i>Add Instance</i> button causes a new instance to be added to the end
 of the table. It is given a unique name.
 
 <p>The <i>Delete Instance</i> button causes the selected instance to be
 deleted from the table.
 
 <p>The <i>Load Feature Vectors</i> button loads a feature_vectors_file ACE XML file into
 memory and displays it. If feature values are already loaded, the user will be given a prompt 
 asking them if they want to continue and previously loaded values will be overwritten.
 
 <p>The <i>Load Classifications</i> button loads a model_classifications_file ACE XML file into
 memory and displays it. If classifications are already loaded, the user will be given a prompt 
 asking them if they want to continue and previously loaded classes will be overwritten.
 
 <p>The <i>Save Feature Vectors</i> button saves the currently loaded feature
 values into the path referred to in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog
 box as a feature_vectors_file ACE XML file. The <i>Save Feature Vectors As</i> button allows the
 user to choose the path to which the file is to be saved and updates the
 path in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog box.
 
 <p>The <i>Save Classifications</i> button saves the currently loaded classifications into the path 
 referred to in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog
 box as a classifications_file ACE XML file. The <i>Save Classifications As</i> button allows the
 user to choose the path to which the file is to be saved and updates the
 path in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog box.
