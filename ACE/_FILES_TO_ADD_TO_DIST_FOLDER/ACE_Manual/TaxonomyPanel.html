<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<blockquote>
This panel displays the class ontology for an ACE project. Ontologies are stored in an ACE XML Taxonomy file. Users are able 
to view, edit, load, and save class ontologies on which classifications can be based.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Display Options</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The currently loaded taxonomy can be seen in one of two 
views. The default view, called the Hierarchical View, allows users to see a hierarchical tree
reflecting the relationships of broad categories going down to narrower
categories. The names of these categories may be edited by clicking on them
(the return button must be pressed to register changes) or by using the
buttons described below. In this view, the status bar displays the total
number of top level categories.</p>
 <p>The second view, called the Ancestry View, allows users to see the
taxonomy in the form of a list of leaf categories. Children of leaf
categories represent a list of all ancestors of the given category. Leaf
categories that appear more than once in the taxonomy are combined into one
under this view (the stored taxonomy itself is not changed) so that all of
the combined ancestors are listed together. The taxonomy is not editable in
this view. In this view, the status bar displays the total number of leaf categories.

<p>Both of the trees in the above two views are sorted alphabetically. The
 <i>Display Hierarchy</i> and <i>Display Ancestry</i> buttons allow users to
 switch between the two views. In both views, a beige bullet next to a
 category means that it has children that can be viewed or hidden by pressing
 on the handle to the left of the bullet, and a blue bullet next to a category
 means that it is a leaf category with no children.
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Panel Contents</strong></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>The <i>New Taxonomy</i> button deletes the current taxonomy and creates a
 new empty taxonomy.
 <p>The <i>Load Taxonomy</i> button loads a taxonomy_file ACE XML file into
 memory and displays it. This overwrites any existing taxonomy. The root node,
 which has no internal significance to ACE, is given the name of the file.
 <p>The <i>Save Taxonomy</i> button saves the currently loaded taxonomy into
 the path referred to in the <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog box as a
 taxonomy_file ACE XML file. The <i>Save As</i> button allows the user to
 choose the path to which the file is to be saved and updates the path in the
 <i>File Path Settings</i> dialog box. The name of the root node, which has no
 internal significance to ACE, is not saved.
 <p>The <i>Add New Sibling Category</i> and the <i>Add New Child</i> buttons
 add a new sibling or a new child category to the taxonomy respectively, with
 a location based on the category that is currently selected by the user. The
 <i>Delete Branch</i> button removes the selected category and its descendants.
