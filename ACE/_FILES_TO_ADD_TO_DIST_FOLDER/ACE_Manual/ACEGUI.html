<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<blockquote>
The ACE GUI is currently under construction. Currently it serves as a tool for viewing and editing ACE XML
files. Eventually, the GUI will be able to be used to perform experiments on data sets. It is divided into 
six panels: Taxonomy, Features, Instances, Preferences, Classification Settings and Experimenter. The
Taxonomy, Features, and Instances panels allow the user to view ACE XML files. The Preferences, 
Classifications Settings, and Experimenter panels are not currently fully implemented, but they are the next 
development priority. In the near future, the Experimenter panel will provide
the ability to perform experiments. 
</blockquote><p></p>
<p><strong>Taxonomy Panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
This panel displays the contents of an ACE XML Taxonomy file. Users are able 
to view, edit, load, and save class ontologies on which classifications can be based. <p></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Feature Definitions Panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The Feature Definitions Panel represents the contents of an ACE XML feature definitions file. This
panel allows users to view, edit, load and save feature definitions. This information relates
to features themselves, not to actual feature values extracted from features.
<p>The features are displayed in table form. This table may be sorted based
on the contents of a given column by clicking on the appropriate column
heading. The contents of any row may be changed by double clicking on any
entry on the table (or clicking once, in the case of check boxes). Columns
may also be reordered by dragging their headings. All features must have
unique names and must have at least 1 dimension. Any attempt to enter invalid
entries will be rejected by the system.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Instances Panel</strong></p>
<blockquote>
This panel represents the combined contents of both the ACE XML feature vectors file and the ACE XML model classifications
file. This panel allows users to view, edit, load and save the classifications and feature values of
a data set. This information relates to the actual feature values, not the features themselves.
<p>If feature vectors and classifications are loaded for the same instance, all information for that 
instance will be presented in one row. For subsections, start and stop times indicate the boundaries 
of the sub-section feature vectors, and the Classes column includes all classifications that overlap 
with that sub-section. The specific time of the overlap of class labels within a sub-section is 
indicated within parentheses after the class name.

<p><strong>Project Files Dialog Box</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The File Path Settings dialog box can be used to find, store, and edit ACE configuration 
file paths. These are the component files of an ACE project. This window can be accessed 
by clicking <i>Load Configuration Files</i> in the <i>File</i> menu.
