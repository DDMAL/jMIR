<P>The <EM>Search Words Panel </EM>is a GUI panel allowing users to select the 
  search strings for which cultural features are to be extracted from the web.</P>
<P><STRONG>Co-occurrence vs. Cross Tabulation Analysis</STRONG></P>
<P>There are two basic types of automated web searches that can be performed. 
  The first, a "<STRONG>co-occurrence extraction</STRONG>" (see Figure 1), means 
  that the relative co-occurrence of each line in the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> 
  text area on the internet is measured pairwise when combined with every other 
  line in the same text area. The <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area 
  is ignored in co-occurrence analyses. This is useful for measuring the relative 
  similarity between each of the primary search strings. For example, in the case 
  of Figure 1 hit counts would be found for all occurrences of both Pearl Jam 
  and Nirvana on the same web page, for both Pearl Jam and Beethoven, for both 
  Pearl Jam and Mozart, and so on until hit counts for all possible pairs of primary 
  search strings had been extracted. </P>

<P><I><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <EM>Search Words Panel

compare the relative pairwise similarity between the names of six different 
musical artists.</P>
<P>The second type of search, &quot;<STRONG>cross tabulation extraction</STRONG>" 
  (see Figure 2), involves calculating the relative pairwise internet co-occurrence 
  of each line in the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area with every line 
  in the <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area. This is useful in categorizing 
  terms. For example, in the case of Figure 2 hit counts would be found for all 
  occurrences of both Pearl Jam and Jazz on the same web page, for both Pearl 
  Jam and Classical, for both Pearl Jam and Grunge, and so on until all possible 
  pairs of one primary search string and one secondary search string been searched.

</EM>showing search strings for a potential cross tabulation extraction that 
will compare the relative associations between each name of six different 
musical artists and each of three different genres of music.</P>
<P>The two radio buttons at the top of the <EM>Search Words Panel</EM> allow 
users to select which one of these two types of analyses they wish to perform. 
Selecting the <EM>Co-occurrence Extraction</EM> radio button will temporarily 
disable the <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area, as it is irrelevant for 
this type of analysis.</P>
<P><STRONG>Synonyms</STRONG></P>
<P>It is possible to define "synonyms" between different search strings so that 
they will be considered equivalent and their results will be combined during 
feature value calculations. This can be done for both primary search strings and 
secondary search strings.</P>
<P>Synonyms can be useful when dealing with search strings that are effectively 
equivalent to other terms, and it is desirable to avoid missing web pages that 
might contain one synonym but not the other. For example, the class names "R and 
B" and "RnB" can be usefully combined. </P>
<P>Synonyms can be defined by entering a " &lt;SYNONYM&gt; " tag between words 
or sets of words in one of the text areas. It is possible to define more than 
two synonyms in a set if desired.</P>
<P>Figure 1 provides an example of how synonyms can be entered. Both "Charlie 
Mingus" and "Charles Mingus" refer to the same artist, so the hits for both will 
be combined during feature extraction.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Text Areas</STRONG></P>
<P>The <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area on the left and the 
<EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area on the right allow users to enter 
the search terms that they wish to use. These may be entered by directly typing 
in or editing the text areas or by copying and pasting existing text into them. 
Search terms may also be added using the <EM>Load</EM> button corresponding to 
the appropriate text area, which parses strings from an existing text file and 
appends them to the appropriate text area. </P>
<P>Note that each search string may contain multiple words and that each line in 
a text area corresponds to a separate search string.</P>
<P>Note that when a feature extraction is executed with the <EM>EXTRACT 
FEATURES</EM> button that the contents of the text fields are pre-processed 
before being used in searches such that blank lines are removed, duplicate lines 
are removed and the contents are sorted alphabetically by line.</P>
<P><STRONG>Buttons Above the Text Areas</STRONG></P>
<P>The <EM>Load</EM> button for each text area allows users to parse the contents 
  of a file and append them to the existing content of the text area (existing 
  contents are <EM>not</EM> replaced). Information can be parsed from newline 
  delimited text files, from class names found in <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html" target=top>Weka 
  ARFF</a> or <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
  XML</a> files, or from a variety of different fields of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple 
  iTunes</a> XML files. In the case of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple 
  iTunes</a> XML files, users are asked to choose which field they want to parse 
  search strings from.</P>
<P>The <EM>Save</EM> button for each text area will bring up a file chooser allowing 
  users to enter a file path. The contents of the text area will be saved as a 
  text file to the chosen location.</P>
<P> The <EM>Clear</EM> buttons for each text area erase all of the contents of 
  the corresponding text area.</P>
<P> The <EM>Organize</EM> buttons for each text area cause the contents of the 
  corresponding text area to be sorted alphabetically by line, with empty lines 
  and duplicate lines removed. </P>
