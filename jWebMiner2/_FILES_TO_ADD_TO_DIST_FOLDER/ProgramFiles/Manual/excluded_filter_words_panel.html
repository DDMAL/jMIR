<P>The <EM>Excluded Filter Words Panel </EM>is a GUI panel allowing users to enter 
  strings that must <EM>not</EM> be found on a site in order for it to be counted 
  as a hit during feature extraction. These&nbsp;excluded filter strings apply 
  to all searches. A screenshot of this panel is shown in Figure 1 with one filter 
  string entered.</P>
<P>Excluded filter strings are useful in eliminating hits that are not relevant 
  to the particular topic for which cultural features are being extracted. For 
  example, it may be desirable to exclude the string "construction" in order to 
  avoid hits from queries involving search strings such as "The Doors" and "heavy 
  metal" that are not relevant to music.</P>
<P>Filter words entered in this panel play the opposite role of filter words entered 
  in the <A href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filters Words Panel</A>. 
  Note that only basic filter strings are permitted in the <EM>Excluded Filter 
  Words Panel</EM>, however, unlike the <A 
href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filters Words Panel</A>, where 
  pattern-based filter strings are also permitted.</P>
<P>Note that excluded filter strings are treated literally in queries regardless 
  of the setting of the&nbsp;<EM>Treat search strings literally</EM> option in 
  the <A href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</A>. This means that all of the 
  words in a filter string must appear on a site in the same order as they appear 
  in the filter string for the site to be excluded&nbsp;from being&nbsp;a hit 
  because of the filter string. For this reason it is unwise to use long filter 
  strings that may disqualify many relevant sites.</P>
<P>Choosing excluded filter strings involves carefully striking a balance between 
  eliminating as many irrelevant hits as possible and including as many relevant 
  hits as possible. For example,&nbsp;it may be useful to use "paradise" as an 
  excluded filter string, as in Figure 1, if a band such as "Nirvana" is a search 
  string, as in the examples in the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>. However, this would be 
  an unwise excluded filter string if the band "The Sabres of Paradise" is also 
  one of the search strings. In general, too many filter words or filter words 
  that are too limiting will have a negative impact on feature values.</P>

<P><STRONG>The Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The text area dominating this panel allows users to enter the filter terms 
that they wish to use. These may be entered by directly typing in or editing the 
text area or by copying and pasting existing text into it.&nbsp;Text may also be 
added using the <EM>Load</EM> button, which parses strings from an existing text 
file and appends them to the text area.</P>
<P>Note that each filter string may contain multiple words and that each line 
corresponds to a separate filter string.</P>
<P>Note that when a feature extraction is executed with the <EM>EXTRACT 
FEATURES</EM> button that the contents of the text field&nbsp;are pre-processed 
before being used in queries such that blank lines are removed, duplicate lines 
are removed and the contents are sorted alphabetically by line.</P>
<P><STRONG>Buttons Above the Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The <EM>Load</EM> button allows users to parse the contents of a text file 
and append them to the existing content of the text area (existing contents are 
<EM>not</EM> replaced). Each line in the text file is treated as a separate 
filter string.</P>
<P>The <EM>Save</EM> button will bring up a file chooser allowing users to enter 
  a file path. The contents of the text area will be saved as a text file to the 
  chosen location.</P>
<P> The <EM>Clear</EM> button erases all of the contents of the text area.</P>
<P> The <EM>Organize</EM> buttons causes the contents of the text area to be sorted 
  alphabetically by line, with empty lines and duplicate lines removed. </P>
