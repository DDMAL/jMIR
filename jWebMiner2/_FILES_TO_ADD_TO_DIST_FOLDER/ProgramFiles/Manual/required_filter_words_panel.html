<P>The <EM>Required Filter Words Panel </EM>is a GUI panel allowing users to enter 
  strings that must be found on a site in order for it to be counted as a hit 
  during feature extraction. These strings are in addition to search strings entered 
  in the <A href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;themselves, 
  and these required filter strings apply to all searches. Both basic and pattern-based 
  filter phrases may also used (see the Pattern-Based Filter Strings section below). 
  A screenshot of this panel is shown in Figure 1 with one filter string entered.</P>
<P> Required filter strings are useful in eliminating hits that are not relevant 
  to the particular topic for which cultural features are being extracted. For 
  example, it may be useful to require that all hits contain the word "music" 
  in order to ensure relevance to a musical feature extraction. Filter words entered 
  in this panel play the opposite role of filter words entered in the <A 
href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded Filters Words Panel</A>.</P>
<P>Note that required filter strings are treated literally in queries regardless 
  of the setting of the&nbsp;<EM>Treat search strings literally</EM> option in 
  the <A href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</A>. This means that all of the 
  words in a filter string must appear on a site in the same order as they appear 
  in the filter string for the site to be counted as a hit. For this reason it 
  is unwise to use long filter strings that may disqualify many relevant sites.</P>
<P>Choosing required filter strings involves carefully striking a balance between 
  eliminating as many irrelevant hits as possible and including as many relevant 
  hits as possible. Too many filter words or filter words that are too limiting 
  will have a negative impact on feature values.</P>

<P><I><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <EM>Required Filter 
Words Panel </EM>with one basic filter string entered.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pattern-Based Filter Strings</STRONG></P>
<P>Filter strings may be either "<STRONG>basic filter strings</STRONG>" or "<STRONG>pattern-based 
  filter strings</STRONG>". In the case of basic filter strings, such as in "musician" 
  in Figure 1, the filter strings are included in queries exactly as they are, 
  without modifications. The line "&lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; played &lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; 
  music" in Figure 2 is an example of pattern-based filter string. Pattern-based 
  filter strings are useful when filter phrases are desired that should include 
  the particular search strings being used in each individual query.</P>
<P>Pattern-based filter strings are those strings that include one of more occurences 
  of either of the following two tags: "&lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt;" or "&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt;". 
  When&nbsp;such a tag is&nbsp;present, the tag is&nbsp;replaced in each query&nbsp;by 
  the search string from the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;that is relevant to 
  the query currently taking place.</P>
<P>Recall that each query submitted by jWebMiner involves two search strings 
from the <A href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>. In the case 
of co-occurrence analysis these will both be from the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH 
STRINGS</EM> section of the <A href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words 
Panel</A>&nbsp;and in the case of a cross tabulation analysis the first will be 
from the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> section of the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;and the sedond will 
be from the <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> section of the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>.</P>
<P>The "&lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt;" and "&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt;" 
tags are therefore replaced by the corresponding search string from the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;for each query. For 
example, consider the case where the"&lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; played 
&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; music" filter string is used and the search 
queries are the same as in Figure 2 of the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;section of this 
manual. Then, for the query involving "Beethoven" and "Jazz", for 
example,&nbsp;the specific filter string submitted to web services&nbsp;would be 
"Beethoven played&nbsp;Jazz music", for the query involving "Beethoven" and 
"Classical" the&nbsp;filter string submitted to web services&nbsp;would be 
"Beethoven played&nbsp;Classical music", and so on.</P>
<P>In the case of co-occurrence analyses, the "&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt;" 
tag is actually replaced by the second primary search string from the 
<EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> section of the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;for each query. For 
example, consider the case where the&nbsp;"&lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; played 
&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; music" filter string is used and the search 
queries are the same as in Figure 1 of the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;section of this 
manual. Then, for the query involving "Beethoven" and "Mozart" the filter string 
submitted to web services&nbsp;would be "Beethoven played&nbsp;Mozart music", 
and so on (which also&nbsp;demonstrates that this particular filter string is 
less appropriate for artist similarity analysis than for musical genre 
classification).</P>
<P>Note that if synonyms are present in the <A 
href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</A>&nbsp;then only the first 
synonym is used to&nbsp; replace the &lt;PRIMARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; or 
&lt;SECONDARY_SEARCH_STRING&gt; tags.</P>

<P><STRONG>The Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The text area dominating this panel allows users to enter the filter terms 
that they wish to use. These may be entered by directly typing in or editing the 
text area or by copying and pasting existing text into it.&nbsp;Text may also be 
added using the <EM>Load</EM> button, which parses strings from an existing text 
file and appends them to the text area.</P>
<P>Note that each filter string may contain multiple words and that each line 
corresponds to a separate filter string.</P>
<P>Note that when a feature extraction is executed with the <EM>EXTRACT 
FEATURES</EM> button that the contents of the text field&nbsp;are pre-processed 
before being used in queries such that blank lines are removed, duplicate lines 
are removed and the contents are sorted alphabetically by line.</P>
<P><STRONG>Buttons Above the Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The <EM>Load</EM> button allows users to parse the contents of a text file 
and append them to the existing content of the text area (existing contents are 
<EM>not</EM> replaced). Each line in the text file is treated as a separate 
filter string.</P>
<P>The <EM>Save</EM> button will bring up a file chooser allowing users to enter 
  a file path. The contents of the text area will be saved as a text file to the 
  chosen location.</P>
<P> The <EM>Clear</EM> button erases all of the contents of the text area.</P>
<P> The <EM>Organize</EM> buttons causes the contents of the text area to be sorted 
  alphabetically by line, with empty lines and duplicate lines removed. </P>
