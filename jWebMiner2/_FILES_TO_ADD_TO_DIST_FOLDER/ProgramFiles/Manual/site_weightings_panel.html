<P>The <EM>Site Weightings Panel </EM>is a GUI panel allowing users to enter specific 
  sites to search&nbsp;individually and separately from the whole available network 
  (or as well as the whole available network, if desired). Relative weights can 
  also be&nbsp;assigned to each site (and/or the whole network)&nbsp;to give&nbsp;certain 
  sources more weight in final feature calculations than others.</P>
<P>Specifying specific sites with this panel is useful when there are certain 
  sites that are known to be particularly good resources for the type of&nbsp;feature 
  extraction to be performed. It can&nbsp;then be&nbsp;useful to emphasize them 
  within or instead of the network as a whole, which might generate hits not relevant 
  to the subject for which features are being extracted . For example, in the 
  case of music queries, sites such as <A href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>All 
  Music</A>, <A 
href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/" target=top>Pitchfork,</A> <A 
href="http://www.freedb.org/" target=top>freeDB</A>, <A 
href="http://www.billboard.com" target=top>Billboard</A>, <A 
href="http://artofthemix.org" target=top>Art of the Mix</A>, <A 
href="http://www.azlyrics.com/" target=top>A-Z Lyrics</A>, etc. can be good sources. 
  It can also be useful to emphasize general resource sites such as <A 
href="http://wikipedia.org/" target=top>Wikipedia</A>&nbsp;or <A 
href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Page" target=top>Citizendium</A>, as 
  they can sometimes be less noisy than the network as a whole. Specifying relative 
  site weightings&nbsp;can be useful when some sources are more&nbsp;trusted than 
  others.</P>
<P><STRONG>Specifying Source&nbsp;Sites</STRONG></P>
<P> If the text area of the&nbsp;<EM>Site Weightings Panel </EM>is left blank 
  then it is assumed that the entire network is to be searched. If one or more 
  sites are specified then they will each be searched separately for each query 
  and the hit counts for each of them will be combined when feature values are 
  calculated. Each line of the text area corresponds to a different source.</P>
<P> If the text area contains at least one specified site, then the whole network 
  will not be searched automatically. If it is desirable to search both the whole 
  network as well as one or more specific sites, then the "&lt;WHOLE_NETWORK&gt;" 
  tag must be placed on one line. An example of this can be seen in Figure 1, 
  where both the whole network and <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com/" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A> specifically will 
  each be searched separately and results combined during final feature calculation.</P>
<P>It should be noted that it may be unwise to specify too many source sites. 
  The reason for this is different for the reason for not specifying too many 
  filter terms (see the <A href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filter 
  Words Panel</A>&nbsp;and <A href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded 
  Filter Terms Panel</A>&nbsp;sections of the manual), however. Entering a large 
  number of source sites will not degrade performance, but it will linearly increase 
  the number of queries that need to be performed, which increases feature extraction 
  processing time and carries the risk of exceeding the daily quotas of individual 
  web services, which further extends processing time.</P>

<P><EM><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG></EM> A screenshot of the <EM>Site Weightings 
  Panel </EM>with both the whole network and specifically the <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A> web site selected 
  to be searched separately. Since no weights are specified the hit counts from 
  both sources will&nbsp;be assigned equal weights during feature calculation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Specifying Relative Weightings</STRONG></P>
<P>If weightings are not specified&nbsp;(as is the case in Figure 1) then all 
  sources are given an equal weighting when final feature values are calculated 
  (although they can optionally be normalized based on&nbsp;overall hit counts 
  if the&nbsp;<EM>Normalize hits across web sites</EM> option&nbsp;is selected 
  in the <A href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</A>, which operates independently 
  of weights assigned to web sites in the <EM>Site Weightings Panel</EM>).</P>
<P> If it&nbsp;is desirable to specify relative weightings, then this can be&nbsp;done 
  using the " &lt;WEIGHT&gt; " tag&nbsp;following a source address (including 
  the possibility of the "&lt;WHOLE_NETWORK_TAG&gt;") and a&nbsp;decimal or integer 
  number. An example of this can be seen in Figure 2, where the whole available 
  network is assigned a weight four times that of <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com/" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A>.</P>
<P> The absolute&nbsp;values&nbsp;of the weights&nbsp;entered have no influence 
  on final feature values, and only the magnitude&nbsp;of the weights relative 
  to one another&nbsp;has an influence on these final values. If weights are entered 
  for some sources but not for others then a weight of 1.0 is assigned by default 
  to sources that have do&nbsp;not have weights explicitly assigned, as if " &lt;WEIGHT&gt; 
  1.0" had been entered following the source.</P>

  Panel </EM>with both the whole network and specifically the <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com/" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A> web site selected 
  to be searched separately. The results from the whole network are assigned 4 
  times the weighting of the results from only the <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com/" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A>&nbsp;site during 
  final feature calculation.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The text area dominating this panel allows users to enter the sites and corresponding 
  weights that they wish to use. These may be entered by directly typing in or 
  editing the text area or by copying and pasting existing text into it.&nbsp;Text 
  may also be added using the <EM>Load</EM> button, which parses strings from 
  an existing text file and appends them to the text area.</P>
<P>Note that each&nbsp;line in&nbsp;the text area corresponds to a separate source.</P>
<P>Note that when a feature extraction is executed with the <EM>EXTRACT FEATURES</EM> 
  button that the contents of the text field&nbsp;are pre-processed before being 
  used in queries such that blank lines are removed, duplicate lines are removed 
  and the contents are sorted alphabetically by line.</P>
<P><STRONG>Buttons Above the Text Area</STRONG></P>
<P>The <EM>Load</EM> button allows users to parse the contents of a text file 
  and append them to the existing content of the text area (existing contents 
  are <EM>not</EM> replaced). Each line in the text file is treated as a separate 
  source.</P>
<P>The <EM>Save</EM> button will bring up a file chooser allowing users to enter 
  a file path. The contents of the text area will be saved as a text file to the 
  chosen location.</P>
<P> The <EM>Clear</EM> button erases all of the contents of the text area.</P>
<P> The <EM>Organize</EM> buttons causes the contents of the text area to be sorted 
  alphabetically by line, with empty lines and duplicate lines removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
