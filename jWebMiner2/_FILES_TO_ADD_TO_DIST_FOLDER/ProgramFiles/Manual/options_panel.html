<P>The <EM>Options Panel</EM> is a GUI panel allowing users to select options 
  affecting the details of feature extraction. This panel is divided into two 
  sections. The left section allows users to select the web service(s) to submit 
  queries to and to set query preferences that affect the types and numbers of 
  hits returned by queries. The right section allows users to set the details 
  of how final&nbsp;feature values will be calculated&nbsp;from raw hit counts&nbsp;and 
  which reports will be displayed in the <A 
href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</A>&nbsp;after feature extraction is complete. 
  A screenshot of the <EM>Options Panel</EM> is shown in Figure 1.</P>

<P><STRONG><EM>Figure 1:</EM></STRONG> A screenshot of the <EM>Options Panel </EM>showing 
  default settings.</P>
<P> This section of the manual is divided into seven sections, one for each of 
  the seven sections of the <EM>Options Panel</EM> interface:</P>
<P><STRONG>1) WEB SERVICES TO SEARCH</STRONG></P>
<P> The options in this section allow the user to control which web services to 
  submit queries to. Passwords to use the services may also be entered here, if 
  appropriate.</P>
<P> Although multiple web services may be selected, this will increase the duration&nbsp;of 
  feature extraction compared to only using one web service.&nbsp;The hit counts 
  for each selected web service are combined during final feature calculation. 
  The limitations of each web service are described in the <A href="hints.html">Hints 
  and Suggestions</A>&nbsp;section of this manual.</P>
<P> It may be useful for those with software development backgrounds to implement 
  additional web services, as described in the <a href="extending.html">Extending 
  the Software</a> section of this manual.</P>
<P> The specific options in this section are as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Yahoo!:</STRONG> Whether queries are to be submitted to the <A 
  href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/web/V1/webSearch.html" 
  target=top>Yahoo! REST-like Web Search web services</A>. The Yahoo! Application 
    Key is hard coded into jWebMiner because Yahoo!'s quota is 5000 queries per 
    day<EM> per source&nbsp;IP address</EM>, so multiple users will not reduce 
    the quota available to each user. 
  <LI><STRONG>Google:</STRONG> Whether queries are to be submitted to the&nbsp;<A href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/apis/reference.html" 
  target=top>Google SOAP web services</A>. A Google distributed License Key must 
    be entered in the <STRONG>License key </STRONG>field for Google to be accessed. 
    This key is not hard coded into&nbsp;jWebMiner because Google imposes a limit 
    of 1000 queries per day with a particular key, regardless of source IP address,&nbsp;so 
    each user needs their own key to avoid reducing the quota available to other 
    users.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>2) GENERAL SEARCH SETTINGS</STRONG></P>
<P> The options in this section allow the user to control miscellaneous settings 
  influencing how searches are performed and what types of results are returned.</P>
<P> It is in general best for users to leave these preferences as they are unless 
  they are expert users. This is because these controls can have significant effect 
  on returned hit counts and because not all of these options are&nbsp;supported 
  by&nbsp;all web services.</P>
<P> The specific options in this section are as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Treat strings literally:</STRONG> Whether all search queries 
  should be literal searches (e.g. for the query "heavy metal"&nbsp;sites must 
  have the two words adjacent if they are to be considered a hit if 
  the&nbsp;search is literal). This is also sometimes known as an exact search 
  or a phrase search. 
  <LI><STRONG>Perform search as OR instead of AND:</STRONG> Whether search queries 
    need only contain one of the specified query words in order to result in a 
    hit. If this is set to true, then only one of the query words must be present. 
    If this is set to false, then all of them must be present (although not necessarily 
    in the specified order, unless the <EM>Treat strings literally</EM> checkbox 
    is selected). It is recommended that the user leave this box unchecked. 
  <LI><STRONG>Include non-matching similar hits:</STRONG> Whether results 
  returned by search queries may include hits that do not contain one or more of 
  the specified query words but do contain terms very similar to them (e.g. 
  alternative spellings). 
  <LI><STRONG>Suppress similar hits:</STRONG> Whether to suppress similar hits 
    when reporting results. Similar in this context means either sites with identical 
    titles and/or descriptions, or multiple hits from the same host. 
  <LI><STRONG>Suppress adult content: </STRONG>Whether to suppress hits that are 
    classified as containing adult content by the search service in question.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>3) LANGUAGE, REGIONAL AND FILE TYPE FILTERS</STRONG></P>
<P> The options in this section allow the user to control filters (of a different 
  type than those in the <A href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filter 
  Words Panel</A>&nbsp;and <A href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded 
  Filter Terms Panel</A>) that limit the types of hits that can be returned. The 
  geographical region that searches&nbsp;are performed in can also be specified. 
  These options must be chosen from the available options in the provided combo 
  boxes. A choice of "No Limitations" means that the corresponding filter is not 
  applied.</P>
<P> The specific options in this section are as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Limit to language:</STRONG> Sets the name of a language that pages 
    must be in in order to be counted as hits. 
  <LI><STRONG>Limit to country:</STRONG> Sets the country that pages must be found 
    in in order to be counted as hits. 
  <LI><STRONG>Search from region:</STRONG> Sets the name of a country where searches 
    will be performed (i.e. where the search service is located). Results are 
    not necessarily limited to this country, however. 
  <LI><STRONG>Limit to file type:</STRONG> Sets the&nbsp;file type&nbsp;that&nbsp;documents 
    must be in in order to be counted as hits.</LI>
</UL>
<p><strong>4) FEATURE SCORE CALCULATION SETTINGS</strong></p>
<P>The options in this section control whether various types of normalization 
  are applied during final feature calculation. None, some or all of these normalizations 
  can be applied. The specific options in this section are as follows:</P>
<ul>
  <LI><STRONG>Normalize hits across web services:</STRONG> Whether hit counts 
    from different web services should be normalized before final feature scores 
    are calculated. This ensures that services that produce fewer hits overall 
    are not underweighted in the final scores. The overall hit counts for each 
    web service are scaled to the overall number of hits of the service with the 
    lowest number of hits. This checkbox has no effect if only one web service 
    is selected in the <em>WEB SERVICES TO SEARCH</em> section of the <em>Options 
    Panel</em>.
  <LI><STRONG>Normalize hits across web sites:</STRONG> Whether hits from different 
    sources (individual web sites and/or the network as a whole, as set in the 
    <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a>) should be 
    normalized before final feature scores are calculated. This ensures that sources 
    that produce fewer hits overall are not underweighted in the final scores. 
    This is separate and in addition to the manual weights that can be imposed 
    on the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a>, which 
    are not affected by whether or not normalization is applied. The overall hit 
    counts for each source are normalized to the overall number of hits of the 
    source with the lowest number of hits overall. This checkbox has no effect 
    if only one source is specified with the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site 
    Weightings Panel</a>. 
  <LI><STRONG>Normalize feature settings:</STRONG> Whether final feature values 
    should be normalized after all other feature calculation steps have been completed. 
    If the <strong>By row rather than overall</strong> checkbox is selected then 
    this normalization is performed on a row by row basis (so that the sum of 
    feature values in each row of the table of feature scores is 1.0), otherwise 
    it is an overall normalization for the table of scores (so that the sum of 
    all feature values is 1.0).
</ul>
<P><strong>5) CO-OCCURRENCE SCORING FUNCTION</strong></P>
<P>The section controls which formula is used to calculate final feature values 
  from hit counts when the <em>Co-Occurrence Extraction </em>option is selected 
  in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a>. These formulas 
  are applied to hit counts after hit counts have been combined across sources 
  (as set in the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a>) 
  and across web services (as set in the <em>WEB SERVICES TO SEARCH</em> section 
  of the <em>Options Panel</em>). These formulas are also applied after source 
  weightings (as set in the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings 
  Panel</a>) and normalizations (as set in the<em> FEATURE SCORE CALCULATION SETTINGS</em> 
  section of the <em>Options Panel</em>) have been used to process hit counts. 
  The exception to this is the <em>Normalize feature settings </em>normalization, 
  which is applied after the chosen formula has been applied.</P>
<P>Which formula is best to use depends on the kind of search that is being performed, 
  and it can be useful to experiment with different formulas. It may also be useful 
  for those with software development backgrounds to implement additional formulas, 
  as described in the <a href="extending.html">Extending the Software</a> section 
  of this manual.</P>
<P>The specific options in this section are given below as well as references 
  to publications that detail their previous use.</P>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>The notation used in the above formulas is defined as follows:</p>

    feature settings </em>normalization, if selected).</li>
  <li>C() refers to the processed hit counts for the input query combined across 
    web services and weighted network sites and after web service and web site 
    normalization, if selected. If only one web service is used and only one source 
    (including the possibility of the whole network) is used then this is just 
    the raw hit count for the input query.</li>
  <li>A is the set of lines in the<em> PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</em> field of the 
    <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a>.</li>
  <li>a1 and a2 each refer to individual elements from the set A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6) CROSS TABULATION SCORING FUNCTION</strong></p>
<P>The section controls which formula is used to calculate final feature values 
  from hit counts when the <em>Cross Tabulation Extraction </em>option is selected 
  in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a>. These formulas 
  are applied to hit counts after hit counts have been combined across sources 
  (as set in the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a>) 
  and across web services (as set in the<em> WEB SERVICES TO SEARCH</em> section 
  of the <em>Options Panel</em>). These formulas are also applied after source 
  weightings (as set in the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings 
  Panel</a>) and normalizations (as set in the<em> FEATURE SCORE CALCULATION SETTINGS</em> 
  section of the <em>Options Panel</em>) have been used to process hit counts. 
  The exception to this is the the <em>Normalize feature settings </em>normalization, 
  which is applied after the chosen formula has been applied.</P>
<P>Which formula is best to use depends on the kind of search that is being performed, 
  and it can be useful to experiment with different formulas. It may also be useful 
  for those with software development backgrounds to implement additional formulas, 
  as described in the <a href="extending.html">Extending the Software</a> section 
  of this manual.</P>
<P>The specific options in this section are given below as well as references 
  to publications that detail their previous use.</P>
<ul>
  <LI>S(a,b) = C(a,b) / C(a)

  <li>S(a,b) = C(a,b) / (1 + SUMcfromB(C(a,c))) </li>
</ul>
<p>The notation used in the above formulas is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>S() refers to the scoring function that outputs feature scores (before <em>Normalize

  <li>a refers to an individual element from the set A.</li>
  <li>b refers to an individual element from the set B.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7) INFORMATION TO REPORT</strong></p>
<P>The options in this section control which types of reports are generated and 
  displayed in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> after feature 
  extraction is complete. These reports are each presented in tables labeled by 
  search strings (except for the <em>Search settings used</em> report). </P>
<P> All, some or none of these reports may be selected, but regardless of the 
  reports selected here feature values are also stored after extraction so that 
  they can be saved in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> as <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
  XML</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html" target=top>Weka 
  ARFF</a> or newline delimited text files. Reports are displayed in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> in the same order that they appear here in the <em>Options Panel</em>. 
  These reports can be useful in debugging and/or understanding why feature scores 
  are as they are, as they can be used to view processing at various intermediate 
  stages. </P>
<P>Note that in the case where the <em>Co-Occurrence Extraction </em>option is 
  selected in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a> that 
  entries on the diagonal of each report table are left empty in each of the reports 
  and are set to 0 if saved, as they are not significant.</P>
<P>The specific options in this section are as follows:</P>
<ul>
  <LI><STRONG>Feature scores:</STRONG> Whether or not to display the final feature 
    scores that may be saved as features after feature extraction is complete. 
    This report is displayed in a table with the highest value in each row italicized 
    and bolded. 
  <LI><STRONG>Combined processed hit counts:</STRONG> Whether or not to display 
    the combined (added) processed hit counts for all web services and sites after 
    pre-processing is complete. This does take into account site weighting and/or 
    source and web service normalization, if they have been selected by the user. 
    It does not include the application of scoring functions or feature score 
    normalization, however. 
  <LI><STRONG>Combined raw hit counts:</STRONG> Whether or not to display the 
    combined hit counts added together across all web services and sites after 
    queries are all completed. This does not take into account site weighting, 
    any normalizations or application of scoring functions. 
  <LI><STRONG>Individual raw hit counts:</STRONG> Whether or not to individually 
    display the raw hit counts for each web service and each network source after 
    queries are all completed but before hit counts have been combined or otherwise 
    processed. 
  <LI><STRONG>Search queries used:</STRONG> Whether or not to display the queries 
    that are actually sent to each of the web services. Note that these queries 
    will not include information that was stored in the actual web service objects 
    themselves, so the queries may appear incomplete in the case of some web services. 
    This report is combined into the same table with the <em>Individual raw hit 
    counts</em> report if it is selected to be generated, and is generated separately 
    if it is not. 
  <LI><STRONG>Search settings used:</STRONG> Whether or not to display the details 
    of all of the settings used to perform feature extractions. This is useful 
    for maintaining a record of the settings used each time that features are 
    extracted.
