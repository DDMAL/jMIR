<p><strong>Running the Software</strong></p>
<p>A file named &quot;jWebMiner.jar&quot; is produced upon <a href="installation.html">installation</a>. 
  The simplest way to start jWebMiner is to simply double click on this file.</p>
<p>The software may also be accessed via the command line (e.g. the DOS prompt). 
  To access DOS under Windows, for example, go to the Start Menu, select Run and 
  type &quot;cmd&quot;. Then use the &quot;cd&quot; command to move to the directory 
  that contains the jWebMiner.jar file. In that directory, type:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> java -jar jWebMiner.jar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the Java Runtime Environment does not always allocate 
  sufficient memory for jWebMiner to process large music collections. Running 
  jWebMiner using either of the above two methods could therefore result in an 
  out of memory error (although this is relatively rare).</p>
<p>It is therefore sometimes preferable to manually allocate a greater amount 
  of memory to jWebMiner before running it. 250 MB should be more than enough 
  for most situations. This can be done by entering the following at the command 
  prompt:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> java -ms16M -mx250M -jar jWebMiner.jar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that your computer must be connected to the internet for jWebMiner to 
  work. It may also be necessary to modify your firewall to allow it access.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Software's Interface</strong></p>
<p>The jWebMiner interface is divided into several panels that may be accessed 
  via tabs below the <a href="menus.html">menu bar</a>. Each of these panels is 
  described in a separate section in this manual, as described below. The <a href="menus.html">menu 
  bar</a> itself allows access to help functionality as well as to the <a href="network_search_dialog.html">Network 
  Search Dialog Box</a>, which allows users to perform side by side searches using 
  multiple web services and see the details of the returned hits. The <em>EXTRACT 
  FEATURES</em> button appears below all of the panels, and it initiates feature 
  extraction using the setting in each of the panels.</p>
<p>The <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a> allows the user 
  to choose the the text phrases (strings) that feature extraction is to be based 
  on, to define synonyms amongst these strings and to decide whether the extraction 
  is to involve co-occurrence or cross-tabulation analysis. The <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required 
  Filter Words Panel</a> allows users to specify strings that must be present 
  on a page in order for it to be counted as a hit and the <a href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded 
  Filter Words Panel</a> allows them to specify words that may not be present 
  if it is to be counted as a hit. The <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site 
  Weightings Panel</a> allows users to specify specific sites that will be searched 
  (including the possibility of the entire available network) and to set variable 
  weighting schemes that will give particular sites greater influence than others 
  on the final feature values. The <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> 
  allows users to select amongst a variety of preferences. Finally, the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> shows the results of feature extractions, which may include a wide 
  variety of information, depending on the settings in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a>. The <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> may also be used 
  to save the results in a variety of file formats.</p>
<p>A <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> is available to give a brief applied 
  introduction to running the software.</p>
<p><strong>Error Messages and Other Problems</strong></p>
<p>jWebMiner generates informative error messages when any problems occur. The 
  reported problems can most often be resolved by following the instructions in 
  the error message. If a problem is encountered that cannot be resolved in this 
  manner, then the <a href="known_issues.html">Problems and Solutions</a> section 
  of the manual should be consulted.</p>
<p>Note that each query will be submitted to a given web services up to 3 times 
  if it is unsuccessful before it is reported to the user, as sometimes the service 
  is simply busy at the moment that a particular query is submitted. If a query 
  fails three times consecutively then the user is presented with the option of 
  either trying up to another 3 times or cancelling the feature extraction.</p>
<p>The results returned by web services are sensitive to the particularities of 
  the search settings and query strings used. The <a href="hints.html">Hints and 
  Suggestions</a> section of the manual can be consulted for tips on improving 
  results.</p>
