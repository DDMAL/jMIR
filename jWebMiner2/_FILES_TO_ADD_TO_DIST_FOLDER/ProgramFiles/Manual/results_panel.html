<p>The <em>Results Panel</em> is a GUI panel allowing users to view and/or save 
  the results of jWebMiner feature extractions, including final feature values, 
  hit counts at various intermediate processing stages and complete details of 
  the settings used during feature extraction. This panel is is disabled until 
  at least one feature extractions has been completed and is automatically brought 
  to the foreground of the GUI when feature extraction is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Reports</strong></p>
<p>The types of reports that will be displayed after a feature extraction is completed 
  depend on the settings chosen by the user in the <em>INFORMATION TO REPORT</em> 
  section of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>. Each of the reports 
  chosen there will be generated and displayed in the <em>Results Panel</em> after 
  feature extraction is complete. These reports are each presented in the form 
  of tables whose rows and columns are labeled based on the search strings entered 
  in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a> (except for 
  the <em>Search Settings Used</em> reports). Synonyms defined in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a> will be grouped together in row and/or column labels.</p>
<p> The types of reports are explained in the following list. Note that they will 
  be generated in the order that they are listed below and that each report type 
  may involve the generation of multiple separate report tables, based on the 
  current search configuration.</p>
<ul>
  <LI><STRONG>Feature Scores Report:</STRONG> Final feature scores generated based 
    on hit counts and processing selected in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>. This report is displayed in a table with the highest value in each 
    row italicized and bolded. 
  <LI><STRONG>Combined Processed Hit Counts Report:</STRONG> The combined (added) 
    processed hit counts for all web services and sites after pre-processing is 
    complete. This does take into account site weighting and/or source and web 
    service normalization, if they have been selected by the user. It does not 
    include the application of scoring functions or feature score normalization, 
    however. 
  <LI><STRONG>Combined Raw Hit Counts Report:</STRONG> The combined hit counts 
    added together across all web services and sites after queries are all completed. 
    This does not take into account site weighting, any normalizations or processing 
    with scoring functions. 
  <LI><STRONG>Individual Raw Hit Counts Report:</STRONG> The separated raw hit 
    counts for each web service and each network source after queries are all 
    completed but before hit counts have been combined or otherwise processed. 
  <LI><STRONG>Search Queries Used Report:</STRONG> The queries that were actually 
    sent to each of the web services. Note that these queries will not include 
    information that was stored in the actual web service objects themselves, 
    so the queries may appear incomplete in the case of some web services. This 
    report is combined into the same table with the <em>Individual Raw Hit Counts 
    Report</em> if it is selected to be generated, and is generated separately 
    if it is not. 
  <LI><STRONG>Search Settings Used Report:</STRONG> The details of all of the 
    settings used to perform feature extraction. This is useful for maintaining 
    a record of the settings used each time that features are extracted. 
</ul>
<p>The <em>Feature Score Report</em> is useful for manually examining final feature 
  values. The <em>Search Settings Used Report</em> is useful for keeping a record 
  of the parameterization used for feature extraction. The other reports can be 
  useful for debugging and/or understanding why feature scores are as they are, 
  as they can be used to view processing at various preliminary stages. </p>
<p>All successful feature extractions will result in the final feature values 
  being stored in memory so that they may be saved, even if no reports are selected 
  to be generated in the <em>INFORMATION TO REPORT</em> section of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a>. The date and time of the feature extraction will also always be displayed 
  in the title area of the <em>Results Panel</em> after feature extraction has 
  ended.</p>
<p><strong> Feature and Page Count Values</strong></p>
<p>The numerical values displayed in the <em>Feature Scores Report</em> and the 
  various intermediate hit count reports indicate the relative strength of the 
  cultural link between the search string in each entry's row and the search string 
  in its corresponding column. The absolute magnitude of each numerical value 
  is not necessarily significant, however. What is significant is the relative 
  magnitude of values in each row (or each table as a whole, if the <em>By row 
  rather than overall</em> option is not selected in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a>).</p>
<p>The nature of each report table depends on whether a feature extraction was 
  a &quot;<em>co-occurrence analysis</em>&quot; or a &quot;<em>cross tabulation 
  </em><em>analysis</em>&quot;, as selected in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>. Figure 1 shows an example of the final feature values for a 
  cross tabulation extraction, as explained in the figure's caption. In the terminology 
  of data mining, the label of each row is essentially an instance name and the 
  label of each column is essentially a class name. The feature value in each 
  entry of each row can be considered to represent an instance's measured membership 
  score in each class relative to the other classes (this blurry distinction between 
  features and classes is different from the traditional separation between the 
  two terms).</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Results_Cross_Tabulation.gif"></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> A screenshot of the <em>Results Panel</em>, 
  showing the final feature values extracted in a cross tabulation analysis of 
  the search strings shown in Figure 2 of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>. The bold italic values indicate the highest values in each 
  row. The feature values in this table essentially represent the classification 
  of the name of each artist into musical genres based on relatively how often 
  they appear on web pages together. Note that the user could scroll down the 
  view in order to view hit counts at various intermediate processing stages or 
  the details of the settings used in the feature extraction. Note also that &quot;Charles 
  Mingus&quot; and &quot;Charlie Mingus&quot; are grouped together in the table 
  because they are defined as synonyms in Figure 2 of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>.</p>
<p>An example of co-occurrence analysis can be seen in Figure 2. The values in 
  the report tables generated during co-occurrence analysis, in contrast to those 
  generated in cross tabulation analysis, measure relative pairwise similarity 
  between each term in a set of terms. The difference between what is referred 
  to here as co-occurrence analysis and cross tabulation analysis is described 
  in more detail in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a> 
  section of this manual. With specific respect to reports, it is useful to add 
  that the results tables for co-occurrence analyses will always be square matrices. 
  Furthermore, the entries on the diagonal are not significant in the final results, 
  since they represent the similarity between each search string and itself (this 
  is significant during intermediate processing, however, and can be seen in some 
  of the intermediate reports labeled &quot;C(a)&quot;). As a result, the entries 
  on the diagonals of the output tables co-occurrence analyses are marked with 
  a hyphen in reports and are stored as 0.0 when saved as feature values.</p>

<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong></em> A screenshot of the <em>Results Panel</em>, 
  showing the final feature values extracted in a co-occurrence analysis of the 
  search strings shown in Figure 1 of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>. The bold italic values indicate the highest values in each 
  row. The feature values in this table essentially represent the similarity of 
  the artists' names based on relatively how often they appear on web pages together. 
  Note that the user could scroll down the view in order to view hit counts at 
  various intermediate processing stages or the details of the settings used in 
  the feature extraction. Note also that &quot;Charles Mingus&quot; and &quot;Charlie 
  Mingus&quot; are grouped together in the table because they are defined as synonyms 
  in Figure 1 of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a>. 
  The <em>SAVE FORMAT</em> combo box has been selected by the user in order to 
  choose the format to save feature values in.</p>
<p><strong>Saving Feature Values and/or Reports</strong></p>
<p>The reports displayed in the <em>Results Panel</em> can be saved exactly as 
  they appear in the GUI as HTML files to be easily read by humans in the future. 
  Final feature values can also be exported to <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
  XML</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html" target=top>Weka 
  ARFF</a> or newline delimited text files to facilitate post-processing by software 
  such as <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE.html" target="top">ACE</a><a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top"></a> 
  or <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top">Weka</a>. </p>
<p>Files can be saved by first choosing the desired file format from the <em>SAVE 
  FORMAT</em> combo box at the top right of the <em>Results Panel</em> and then 
  pressing the <em>Save </em> button at the top left.</p>
