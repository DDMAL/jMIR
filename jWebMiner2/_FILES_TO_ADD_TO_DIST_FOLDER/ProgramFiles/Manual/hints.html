<p> This section of the manual provides tips for improving the quality of feature 
  extraction results. jWebMiner allows network searches to be performed using 
  a wide variety of possible settings, and some of these settings will be better 
  suited for particular types of tasks than others.</p>
<p>Material will be added to this section as the current version continues to 
  be used and tested and as particularly effective practices become evident. The 
  tips available so far are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency of Results:</strong> The exact hit counts reported by web services for a given query will change with time, as the web changes. Reported hit counts can also change slightly from moment to moment, as they are often approximations and algorithms do not always emphasize consistency. So, slight differences between two consecutive identical queries should not be a cause for alarm, as this is the nature of the algorithms used by many web services, and it should not significantly impact final results.</li>
  <li><strong>Performing Initial Test Runs:</strong> Feature extractions involving 
    many search strings can be time consuming, depending on the time that the 
    particular web services used take to respond to individual queries. It can 
    therefore be useful to perform small test runs initially using a subset of 
    the total search strings in order to verify that results are reasonable before 
    performing a full feature extraction. If results are surprising, see the debugging 
    and fine-tuning sections below. </li>
  <li><strong>Debugging Surprising Results:</strong> If the numerical results 
    displayed in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> are surprising, 
    it can be useful to use the <a href="network_search_dialog.html">Network Search 
    Dialog</a> to duplicate searches so that the specific hits that resulted in 
    feature values can be examined in detail. Ways in which what is revealed can 
    be addressed are described below under Fine-tuning Results. Enabling the generation 
    all of the reports possible can also be helpful (which reports are generated 
    can be set at the bottom right of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Fine-tuning Results:</strong> jWebMiner allows many settings which 
    can be used to fine-tune results. Several of the key ways in which this can 
    be done are described below: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filter Strings:</strong> It can sometimes be useful to require 
        that all hits must include or not include particular strings in order 
        to be counted as hits. For example, it may be useful to require that all 
        hits contain the word &quot;music&quot; in order to ensure relevance to 
        a musical feature extraction. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to require 
        that certain words be excluded. For example, it may be desirable to exclude 
        the string &quot;construction&quot; in order to avoid non-relevant hits 
        between &quot;The Doors&quot; and &quot;heavy metal&quot;. Filter strings 
        may be set in the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required 
        Filter Words Panel</a> and the <a href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded 
        Filter Words Panel</a>. The required filter strings may also be set to 
        vary based on the particular search terms being used, as described in 
        the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filter Words Panel</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Search String Synonyms:</strong> Sometimes it is useful to combine 
        the results for multiple search strings that are effectively equivalent. 
        For example, the class names &quot;R and B&quot; and &quot;RnB&quot; can 
        be usefully combined. Synonyms may be defined in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
        Words Panel</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Weighting Sites:</strong> It can sometimes be useful to pay 
        special attention to particular sites as well as or instead of the whole 
        network when searching. Site weightings and limitations can be set in 
        the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature Calculation Settings:</strong> The right side of the 
        <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> allows users to set the 
        ways in which raw hit counts are manipulated to generate feature scores. 
        Although changing these does not allow fine-tuning as customized as the 
        above three approaches, it does allow global changes that can be appropriate 
        for particular types of feature extraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Settings:</strong> The left side of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
        Panel</a> allows a variety of additional search parameters to be set. 
        However, it is advised that users first attempt to customize filter strings, 
        synonyms and site weightings, as the defaults set in the left side of 
        the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> are usually best left 
        as they are.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Phrasing Queries:</strong> All queries sent to web services by jWebMiner 
    are automatically phrased and custom-formatted as text-based queries by jWebMiner 
    before they are sent. Since this is the ultimate form that they will take, 
    users should exercise some basic caution when entering search strings. More 
    specifically: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Escape Characters: </strong>Do not use special or escape characters 
        (e.g. slashes) in search strings entered in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
        Words Panel</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Long Queries: </strong>Do not make queries too complex or use 
        too many words in them, as this may cause the queries to be truncated 
        by web services with maximum query lengths (see below).</li>
      <li><strong>Literal Searches: </strong>The default set under the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
        Panel</a> is that all search strings and filter strings are searched literally. 
        This means, for example, that a site searched for the string &quot;The 
        Allman Brothers Band&quot; must contain all of these words exactly and 
        sequentially to be counted as a hit, and that a site containing &quot;The 
        Allman Brothers is a great band&quot; will not be counted if the search 
        is literal.. Although the literal search option can be disabled, literal 
        searches typically results in less noisy results. If literal searches 
        are used, however, excessively long strings should be avoided, as too 
        long strings may cut down the number of appropriate sites which are counted 
        as hits. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Limitations of Supported Web Services:</strong> The web services 
    accessed by jWebMiner have some inherent limitations of their own. In particular, 
    not all of the functionality provided by the left side of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a> is available in all services. Specifically: 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yahoo!</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li> Suppressing similar hits affects the returned search results but 
            not the returned hit count.</li>
          <li>There is no functionality for searching for similar but non-matching 
            strings.</li>
          <li>Searches cannot be performed using a service located specifically 
            in Turkey.</li>
          <li>Only up to 5000 queries may be performed per day per IP address.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Google:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li> There is no functionality for searching for similar but non-matching 
            strings.</li>
          <li>There is no functionality for performing searches using a service 
            located in a specific country.</li>
          <li>There is a maximum of 10 words per query.</li>
          <li>Only up to 1000 queries may be performed per day. This quota refers 
            to queries from all IP addresses combined.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
