<p><strong>Compatibility Issues</strong></p>
<p>The jWebMiner software is written in <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>Java</a>, 
  which means that it can theoretically be run on any system that has the Java 
  Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It is recommended that this software 
  be used with Windows XP, however, as it was developed and tested under the Windows 
  XP operating system, and the interface&#8217;s appearance was developed under 
  Windows. Although the software should theoretically run under earlier versions 
  of Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris or any other operating system with the JRE 
  installed on it, users should be advised that the software has not yet been 
  tested on other platforms, so difficulties may be encountered.</p>
<p>This software was developed with version 1.6.0 of the JDK (Java Development 
  Kit), so it is suggested that the corresponding version or higher of the JRE 
  be installed on the user's computer.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the Java Runtime Environment</strong></p>
<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, you may skip this section. If 
  not, you will need to install it in order to run jWebMiner. The JRE can be downloaded 
  for free from the <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>java.sun.com</a> 
  web site. The JDK includes the JRE.</p>
<p>When the download is complete, follow the installation instructions that come 
  with it in order to install it. </p>
<p><strong>Installing jWebMiner</strong> </p>
<p>The jWebMiner software is delivered in a zipped file, from which jWebMiner 
  can be extracted using any of a variety of dearchiving utilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target=top>WinZip</a>).</p>
<p>There are two versions of jWebMiner, namely the development version and the 
  user version. The user version contains everything needed to run jWebMiner, 
  but does not include any source code. The developer version does include source 
  code.</p>
<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves 
  extracting this directory to any desired disk location. See the <a href="running.html">Using 
  the Software</a> section for information on running the program. A file entitled 
  <a href="splash.html">Manual.html</a> is among the files extracted, and it can 
  be used to view instructions on using the software.</p>
<p>The developer version presents jWebMiner in the form of a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target=top>NetBeans</a> 
  project. Five directories are contained in the zipped distribution file:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> jWebMiner: </strong>Contains the jWebMiner source and bytecode 
    files, as well as other NetBeans project documents and general documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>ThirdPartyJars:</strong> Contains the third party software used 
    by jWebMiner. Further information is available in the <a href="licenses.html">licenses</a> 
    section of the manual.</li>
  <li><strong>UtilityClasses:</strong> General jMIR classes, including source 
    code, used by jWebMiner.</li>
  <li><strong>ACE:</strong> The jMIR ACE NetBeans project, including source code. 
    jWebMiner uses some classes from this software.</li>
  <li><strong>jMusicMetaManager:</strong> The jMIR jMusicMetaManager NetBeans 
    project, including source code. jWebMiner uses some classes from this software.</li>
</ul>
