<p>This section of the manual provides a brief guided tour of jWebMiner's basic 
  functionality. More details as well as significant additional functionality 
  not discussed in this tutorial can be accessed in the other sections of this 
  manual.</p>
<p><strong>First Steps</strong></p>
<p>Begin by installing the jWebMiner software if it has not already been installed. 
  Details on how to do this are provided in the <a href="installation.html">Installation</a> 
  section of this manual. Then run the software by double clicking on the jWebMiner.jar 
  file, as described in the <a href="running.html">Using the Software</a> section 
  of this manual.</p>
<p>The jWebMiner interface is divided into several panels that may be accessed 
  via tabs below the <a href="menus.html">menu bar</a>. Each of these panels is 
  described in a separate section of this manual, and each panel is also introduced 
  in this tutorial. The <a href="menus.html">menu bar</a> itself allows access 
  to additional functionality, such as the <a href="network_search_dialog.html">Network 
  Search Dialog Box</a>, but will not be coved in this tutorial. The <em>EXTRACT 
  FEATURES</em> button appears below all of the panels, and it initiates feature 
  extraction using the setting in all of the panels, regardless of which panel 
  is currently in the interface's foreground.</p>
<p><strong>The Search Words Panel</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words Panel</a> is the panel that 
  is placed in the interface's foreground when jWebMiner is launched. This panel 
  allows users to select the search strings for which cultural features are to 
  be extracted from the web. It allows two types of feature extractions, namely 
  "co-occurrence extraction" and &quot;cross tabulation extraction". These can 
  be selected using the radio buttons at the top of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>.</p>
<p>We will begin with a co-occurrence analysis. In this type of analysis the relative 
  co-occurrence on the internet of each line in the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> 
  text area is measured pairwise when combined with every other line in the same 
  text area. In other words, the feature values produced are based on relatively 
  how frequently each string in the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area 
  appears on the same web page as each other string. The <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH 
  STRINGS</EM> text area is ignored in co-occurrence analyses. Co-occurrence analysis 
  is useful for measuring the relative similarity between each of the primary 
  search strings. In order to see how this works, enter the musical artist names 
  shown in Figure 1 into the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area.</p>
<p><IMG src="Screenshot_Search_Words_with_Primary_and_Synonym.gif"></p>
<P><I><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a><em> </em>showing search strings for a co-occurrence extraction 
  that will compare the relative pairwise similarity between the names of six 
  different musical artists.</P>
<p>In this example, hit counts will be found for all occurrences of both Pearl 
  Jam and Nirvana on the same web page, for both Pearl Jam and Beethoven, for 
  both Pearl Jam and Mozart, and so on until hit counts for all possible pairs 
  of primary search strings have been extracted. This means that jWebMiner will 
  effectively measure the cultural similarity of each pair of these musical artists 
  based on how many web pages they both appear on.</p>
<p>Notice that the first line in Figure 1 contains a &quot;&lt;SYNONYM&gt;&quot; 
  tag. This is so that the hit counts for &quot;Charles Mingus&quot; and &quot;Charlie 
  Mingus&quot; will be combined, as they refer to the same artist. More details 
  on synonyms are provided in the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search Words 
  Panel</a> section of this manual.</p>
<p><strong>Performing a Co-Occurrence Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Co-Occurrence Extraction</em> radio button on the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a> is selected by default, so we are prepared to begin feature 
  extraction. In order to do this, press the <em>EXTRACT FEATURES</em> button 
  at the bottom of the jWebMiner interface. This will cause a progress bar to 
  appear, as shown in Figure 2. This progress bar will be displayed any time that 
  the <em>EXTRACT FEATURES</em> button is pressed, and the user can press the 
  <em>Cancel</em> button to stop processing at any time.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Progress_Bar.gif"> </p>
<p><STRONG><em>Figure 2:</em></STRONG> A screenshot of the feature extraction 
  progress bar. </p>
<p>If a problem occurs during processing then a dialog box will be displayed describing 
  the problem and allowing the user to cancel processing or perform some other 
  action, as appropriate to the situation. Note that each query will be submitted 
  to a given web services up to 3 times if it is unsuccessful before it is reported 
  to the user, as sometimes the service is simply busy at the moment that a particular 
  query is submitted. If a query fails three times consecutively then the user 
  is presented with the option of either trying up to another 3 times or cancelling 
  the feature extraction.</p>
<p>Once processing is complete, the <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> 
  will be brought to the foreground of the graphical user interface, as shown 
  in Figure 3. Note that the exact numerical results that you encounter when performing 
  this feature extraction may be slightly different than those shown here, as 
  the web changes with time.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Results_Cooccurrence.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> </em>A screenshot of the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> showing the final feature values extracted using the search strings 
  shown in Figure 1. The <em>SAVE FORMAT</em> combo box has been selected by the 
  user in order to choose the format to save feature values in.</p>
<p>The table shown in Figure 3 indicates the feature values that have been extracted 
  for each of the search strings specified in Figure 1. The feature value in each 
  entry of the table essentially represents the cultural similarity of the artist 
  in the entry's row with the artist in the entry's column, based on relatively 
  how often the two artists appear on web pages together. The absolute magnitude 
  of each numerical value is not necessarily significant, however. What is significant 
  is the relative magnitude of values in each row. The bold italic values indicate 
  the highest values in each row.</p>
<p>Note that &quot;Charles Mingus&quot; and &quot;Charlie Mingus&quot; are grouped 
  together in the table because they are defined as synonyms in Figure 1. Note 
  also that the entries on the diagonal are marked with hyphens, as they represent 
  the similarity between each search string and itself .</p>
<p>The <a href="results_panel.html">Results Panel</a> can in fact show many more 
  types of reports than simply feature values, as discussed in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> section of this manual, but they are beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>Once features such as those shown in Figure 3 have been extracted, it can then 
  be useful to save them to disk for future access or post-processing. Two types 
  of saving can be performed. The reports shown in the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> can be saved exactly as they appear in the interface as HTML files 
  to be easily read by humans in the future. Alternatively, final feature values 
  can be exported to <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
  XML</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/arff.html" target=top>Weka 
  ARFF</a> or newline delimited text files to facilitate post-processing by software 
  such as <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE.html" target="top">ACE</a><a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top"></a> 
  or <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top">Weka</a>. In 
  order to do either of these, choose the desired file format using the <em>SAVE 
  FORMAT</em> combo box at the top right of the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> and then press the <em>Save </em> button at the top left.</p>
<p><strong>Performing a Cross Tabulation Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Let us now turn to the second type of feature extraction that can be performed 
  with jWebMiner, namely cross tabulation analyses. Return to the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a> by pressing on the <em>Search Words</em> tab. Then click on 
  the <em>Cross Tabulation Extraction </em>radio button on the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a>. This will enable the text area labeled <em>SECONDARY SEARCH 
  STRINGS</em>. Enter the musical genre names into this text area that are shown 
  in Figure 4.<em> </em></p>
<p><IMG src="Screenshot_Search_Words_with_Secondary.gif"></p>
<P><I><STRONG>Figure 4:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <a href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</a><em> </em>showing search strings for a cross tabulation extraction 
  that will compare the relative associations between the names of six different 
  musical artists and each of three different genres of music.</P>
<p>In cross tabulation analyses jWebMiner calculates the relative pairwise internet 
  co-occurrence of each line in the <EM>PRIMARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area 
  with every line in the <EM>SECONDARY SEARCH STRINGS</EM> text area. This is 
  useful in categorizing terms. In the case illustrated in Figure 4, the extent 
  to which each of the 6 artists are associated with each of the 3 genres will 
  be measured by the features extracted.</p>
<p>Initiate feature extraction by once again pressing the <em>EXTRACT FEATURES</em> 
  button. Results such as those in Figure 5 will be displayed once processing 
  is complete. Once again results are displayed as a table, although it is no 
  longer appropriate to enter a hyphen in some table entries, as all entries are 
  relevant in cross tabulation analyses. The value in each entry of each row can 
  be considered to represent an artist's measured membership score in each genre 
  relative to the other genres. As was the case with co-occurrence analysis, the 
  results can be saved in a variety of file formats.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Results_Cross_Tabulation.gif"></p>
<p><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> A screenshot of the <a href="results_panel.html">Results 
  Panel</a> showing the final feature values extracted in a cross tabulation analysis 
  of the search strings shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p><strong> Filter Words</strong> </p>
<p>Although the results shown in Figures 3 and 5 are not bad, it can sometimes 
  be useful to reduce the noisiness in final feature values by eliminating hits 
  that are included in page counts that are not relevant to the topic at hand. 
  For example, although in Figure 5 Mozart is clearly correctly classified as 
  classical music, his value for grunge music is still non-zero, which is an example 
  of noise, as it is unreasonable to classify Mozart as a composer of grunge music. 
  jWebminer provides functionality for using two kinds of &quot;filter strings&quot; 
  that can be entered in the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required 
  Filter Words Panel</a> or the <A 
href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded Filters Words Panel</A> to help 
  reduce such noise.</p>
<p>Let us begin by considering &quot;required filter strings&quot; in the context 
  of the experiment shown in Figure 4. Here the experiment is related to music, 
  so any hits unrelated to music can be considered noise as far as feature extraction 
  is concerned. For example, a site on Hinduism might easily include both the 
  words &quot;Nirvana&quot; and &quot;Classical&quot;, and would therefore contribute 
  a hit to hit counts, but would have nothing to do with music, and would thus 
  be a false count. The <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filter 
  Words Panel</a> allows users to enter strings that must be found on a site in 
  order for it to be counted as a hit during feature extraction. These strings 
  are in addition to search strings entered in the <A href="search_words_panel.html">Search 
  Words Panel</A>&nbsp;themselves, and these required filter strings apply to 
  all searches. </p>
<p>Choosing required filter strings involves carefully striking a balance between 
  eliminating as many irrelevant hits as possible and including as many relevant 
  hits as possible. Too many filter words or filter words that are too limiting 
  will have a negative impact on feature values. Consider the required filter 
  strings shown in Figure 6, which contains two filter strings, namely &quot;music&quot; 
  and &quot;composer&quot;. The choice of &quot;music&quot; is probably a good 
  one, as it helps to ensure that all counted hits are relevant to music. Although 
  it is true that there may certainly be relevant pages that do not contain the 
  word &quot;music&quot; explicitly and will thus be eliminated from page counts 
  by this filter string, recall that the absolute number of pages counted is not 
  important compared to well balanced ratios between search strings. The &quot;music&quot; 
  filter is unlikely to systematically unbalance results, but is likely to eliminate 
  noise, so it is likely a good choice for a required filter word.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Required_Filter_Words_Two.gif"></p>
<p><I><STRONG>Figure 6:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required 
  Filter Words Panel</a> with two basic filter strings entered.</p>
<p>The &quot;composer&quot; filter is likely a poorer choice, however. Although 
  it would likely be a good choice if only classical composers were being considered, 
  for example, it is much less likely that the word composer will be mentioned 
  with respect to other genres of music, such as grunge. This filter term therefore 
  holds the danger of introducing a systematic bias that could unbalance feature 
  values.</p>
<p>Before moving on, it should be mentioned that the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required 
  Filter Words Panel</a> can process more sophisticated filter strings than those 
  shown in Figure 6. Details are provided in the <em>Pattern-Based Filter Strings</em> 
  section of the <a href="required_filter_words_panel.html">Required Filter Words 
  Panel</a> portion of this manual.</p>
<P>The opposite of required filter strings are &quot;excluded filter strings&quot;. 
  These are strings that may <em>not</em> be present on a web site if it is to 
  be counted in page counts. Excluded filter strings may be entered using the 
  <A 
href="excluded_filter_words_panel.html">Excluded Filters Words Panel</A>, shown 
  in Figure 7.</P>
<P>Choosing excluded filter strings also involves carefully striking a balance 
  between eliminating as many irrelevant hits as possible and including as many 
  relevant hits as possible. For example,&nbsp;it may be useful to use "paradise" 
  as an excluded filter string, as in Figures 7, if a band such as "Nirvana" is 
  a search string. However, this would be an unwise excluded filter string if 
  the band "The Sabres of Paradise" is also one of the search strings, as it would 
  not receive any hits. In general, too many filter words, filter words that are 
  too limiting or filter words that are inappropriate given the search strings 
  being used will have a negative impact on feature values.</P>
<P>.<IMG src="Screenshot_Excluded_Filter_Words.gif"></P>
<P><I><STRONG>Figure 7:</STRONG></I> A screenshot of the <EM>Excluded Filter Words 
  Panel </EM>with one filter string entered.</P>
<P><strong>Specifying Source Sites and Source Weightings</strong> </P>
<p>As discussed above, filter strings can sometimes be imperfect or incomplete 
  solutions to reducing feature noise. Another approach is to limit queries to 
  specific web sites rather than the web as a whole, or to emphasize particular 
  sites. For example, in the case of music queries, sites such as <A href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>All 
  Music</A>, <A 
href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/" target=top>Pitchfork,</A> <A 
href="http://www.freedb.org/" target=top>freeDB</A>, <A 
href="http://www.billboard.com" target=top>Billboard</A>, <A 
href="http://artofthemix.org" target=top>Art of the Mix</A>, <A 
href="http://www.azlyrics.com/" target=top>A-Z Lyrics</A>, etc. can be good sources.</p>
<p>The <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a><em> </em>allows 
  users to enter specific sites to search&nbsp;individually and separately from 
  the whole available network (or as well as the whole available network, if desired). 
  Relative weights can also be&nbsp;assigned to each site (and/or the whole network)&nbsp;to 
  give&nbsp;certain sources more weight in final feature calculation than others, 
  although this is beyond the scope of this tutorial (details are provided in 
  the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings Panel</a><em></em> 
  section of this manual).</p>
<p>If the text area of the&nbsp;<a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site Weightings 
  Panel</a><em> </em>is left blank then it is assumed that the entire network 
  is to be searched. If one or more sites are specified then they will each be 
  searched separately for each query and the hit counts for each of them will 
  be combined when final feature values are calculated. Each line of the text 
  area corresponds to a different source.</p>
<p> If the text area contains at least one specified site, then the whole network 
  will not be searched automatically. If it is desirable to search both the whole 
  network as well as one or more specific sites, then the "&lt;WHOLE_NETWORK&gt;" 
  tag must be placed on one line. An example of this can be seen in Figure 8, 
  where both the whole network and <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com/" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A> specifically will 
  each be searched separately and results combined during final feature calculation.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it may be unwise to specify too many source sites. 
  The reason for this is different for the reason for not specifying too many 
  filter terms, however. Entering a large number of source sites will not degrade 
  performance, but it will linearly increase the number of queries that need to 
  be performed, which increases feature extraction processing time and carries 
  the risk of exceeding the daily quotas of individual web services, which further 
  extends processing time. Note also that excluding the whole network and only 
  including a few sites can result in no hits being found for certain search strings, 
  which is problematic.</p>
<P><IMG src="Screenshot_Site_Weightings.gif"></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Figure 8:</STRONG></EM> A screenshot of the <a href="site_weightings_panel.html">Site 
  Weightings Panel</a> with both the whole network and specifically the <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A> web site selected 
  to be searched separately. Since no weights are specified the hit counts from 
  both sources will&nbsp;be assigned equal weights during feature calculation.</P>
<P><strong>Additional Options</strong></P>
<P>There are a variety of other settings that can be used to affect which web 
  services are used to generate hit counts, what conditions are placed on the 
  queries that are submitted to web services, how feature values are calculated 
  and which reports are generated. Although beyond the scope of this tutorial, 
  they are discussed in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> section 
  of this manual.</P>
<P><IMG src="Screenshot_Options.gif"></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Figure 9:</EM></STRONG> A screenshot of the <EM>Options Panel </EM>showing 
  default settings.</P>
<P><strong>Improving Feature Extractions</strong></P>
<P>It has been discussed above how inappropriate filter words or too many filter 
  words and sites can compromise feature quality. An example of this is shown 
  in Figure 10, which resulted from a feature extraction with the settings in 
  Figures 4, 6, and 7 and a source limitation to <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A>. Although the results 
  are better in some ways than in Figure 5, they are worse overall. For example, 
  although Mozart has an even higher rating for the classical genre, and a 0 membership 
  in grunge (both of which are improvements over the results shown in Figure 5), 
  a serious problem becomes apparent with Mingus: no hits were found that met 
  the combined requirements of the required filter strings, excluded filter string, 
  and source limitation to <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A>. This means that 
  it was impossible to classify Mingus. </P>
<p><img src="Screenshot_Results_Overloaded.gif"></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 10:</strong></em> Results from a feature extraction with 
  the settings in Figures 4, 6, and 7 and a source limitation to <A 
href="http://www.allmusic.com" target=top>www.allmusic.com</A>.</p>
<p>Figure 9 therefore illustrates an important principle to consider when extracting 
  cultural features from the web: exercise judicious thought and care when imposing 
  limitations on queries to avoid compromising results. Additional ideas for improving 
  feature extractions are provided in the <a href="hints.html">Hints and Suggestions</a> 
  section of this manual.</p>
