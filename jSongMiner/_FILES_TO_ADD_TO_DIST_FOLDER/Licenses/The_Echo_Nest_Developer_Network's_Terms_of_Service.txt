MISCELLANEOUS - This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Licensee and The Echo Nest pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all written or oral agreements with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating to the interpretation thereof, shall be governed by and construed under Massachusetts law as such law applies to agreements between Massachusetts residents entered into and to be performed within Massachusetts by two residents thereof and without reference to its conflict of laws principles or the United Nations Conventions for the International Sale of Goods. Except to the extent otherwise determined by The Echo Nest, any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be brought in the Federal District of Massachusetts or in state court in Massachusetts and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding, waiving any objections to such venue, including forum non conveniens. The prevailing party in any action arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorneys' fees. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by The Echo Nest. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of The Echo Nest to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit The Echo Nest's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of control involving Licensee) without The Echo Nest's prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. The Echo Nest expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.
