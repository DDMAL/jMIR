<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section describes the licensing under which jSongMiner is distributed, 
  and highlights the associated liability waiver. It also briefly describes each 
  of the Java .jar libraries, executables and web services used and accessed by 
  jSongMiner. Copies of each of the licenses referred to here are included with 
  the jSongMiner distribution. Finally, thanks are provided to the agencies that 
  helped make jSongMiner possible.</p>

<p> <strong>WEB SERVICES USED BY JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>The following web services are used by jSongMiner. Note that users of jSongMiner 
  must acquire their own API keys and enter them into jSongMiner's configuration 
  file in order to access these web services through jSongMiner, as described 
  below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Echo Nest API: </strong>The <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/" target="top">Echo 
    Nest API</a> is a collection of web services that are used by jSongMiner to 
    identify audio and acquire metadata about songs and artists. A free Echo Nest 
    API key must be acquired by each user from <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/account/register" target="top">http://developer.echonest.com/account/register</a> 
    in order to access the Echo Nest API's services. So, users of jSongMiner must 
    acquire such an API key and enter it into the jSongMiner configurations settings 
    file in order to access Echo Nest web services through jSongMiner. Information 
    on The <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/terms" target="top">Echo Nest 
    Developer Network's Terms of Service</a> is packaged with the jSongMiner distribution 
    for reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Last.FM API: </strong>The <a href="http://www.last.fm/api" target="top">Last.FM 
    API</a> is a collection of web services that are used by jSongMiner to acquire 
    metadata about songs, artists and albums. The API is described at http://www.last.fm/api. 
    A free Last.FM API key is needed to access the Last.FM web services. In order 
    to acquire one, users must first create a Last.FM account (<a href="https://www.last.fm/join" target="top">https://www.last.fm/join</a>), 
    if they do not have one already, and then apply for an API key. The web services 
    may then be accessed in accordance with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/tos" target="top">Last.FM 
    API Terms of Service</a>, a copy of which is included in the jSongMiner distribution 
    for reference. Users must each acquire their own Last.FM API Key and enter 
    it into the jSongMiner configuration file before they will be able to access 
    Last.FM functionality using jSongMiner.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES USED BY JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p> The following Java .jar files serve as jSongMiner libraries, and are packaged 
  with jSongMiner:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apache Xerces:</strong> The <a href="http://xerces.apache.org" target="top">Xerces 
    Java library</a> is used by jSongMiner to parse jSongMiner configuration XML 
    files and ACE XML 1.1 Classifications files. It is distributed under the terms 
    of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="top">Apache 
    License, Version 2.0</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Jaudiotagger: </strong>The <a href="http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/" target="top">Jaudiotagger</a> 
    library is used by jSongMiner to extract embedded metadata from a variety 
    of file formats. This software is distributed under a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" target="top">GNUL 
    Lesser General Public License, Version 3.0</a>. </li>
  <li><strong>jEN-api: </strong>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jen-api/" target="top">jEN-api</a> 
    library is used to send requests and interpret returned results from the Echo 
    Nest API. It is distributed under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" target="top">OSI 
    BSD license</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>JSON.simple:</strong> The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/" target="top">JSON.simple</a> 
    library is used to parse JSON-formatted data. This software is distributed 
    under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="top">Apache 
    License, Version 2.0</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>last.fm-bindings:</strong> The <a href="http://u-mass.de/lastfm" target="top">last.fm-bindings</a> 
    library is used to send requests and interpret returned results from the Last.FM 
    API. It is distributed under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" target="top">OSI 
    BSD license</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> THIRD-PARTY EXECUTABLES USED BY JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>The following binary executable is used by jSongMiner. For licensing reasons, 
  users must download it themselves, as instructed below, and enter information 
  allowing jSongMiner to access it into the jSongMiner configuration file:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ENMFP Code Generator: </strong>These libraries and binaries are 
    used to generate fingerprints from audio files that can be sent to the Echo 
    Nest API in order to identify them. A description is available at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/enmfp" target="top">http://groups.google.com/group/enmfp</a>. 
    They are not included with the jSongMiner distribution, as one must seek permission 
    from <a href="http://the.echonest.com/" target="top">The Echo Nest</a> in 
    order to download them, at least as of the time of this writing. They are 
    distributed by The Echo Nest under the Code Generator Library License and 
    Distribution Agreement, available at <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/downloads/license " target="top">http://developer.echonest.com/downloads/license</a>, 
    which is itself included for reference with the jSongMiner distribution. After 
    downloading the code generator, users must then enter information into the 
    jSongMiner configuration file so that the software is able to access the code 
    generator.</li>
</ul>
