<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section describes the jSongMiner configuration file, which specifies various 
  processing settings. Explanations of each of the configuration settings are 
  included.</p>
<p> <strong>OVERVIEW OF THE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS FILE</strong></p>
<p>jSongMiner stores a number of processing settings in a configuration file named 
  &quot;jSongMinerConfigs.xml&quot; that is stored in the same directory as the 
  jSongMiner.jar file. The configuration file must have this name, and it must 
  be in this directory, otherwise it will not be detected by jSongMiner. If jSongMiner 
  cannot detect such a configuration file when it is run, it will auto-generate 
  one with default settings. If jSongMiner in not operating as expected, it is 
  generally a good idea to check the configuration file in order to verify that 
  the settings are appropriate for the type of operation desired. </p>
<p>The configuration file follows a simple XML schema (specified in the file's 
  DTD) where each setting has a single corresponding XML element, and the text 
  contained in each element indicates the setting for that element. There are 
  no nested settings and no attributes used.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to edit the text contained in the XML elements using a 
  text editor or other appropriate application in order to change the settings. 
  Users who wish to use all of the fingerprinting and web services accessible 
  by jSongMiner will need to enter associated data into the appropriate configuration 
  fields as part of the installation process.</p>
<p>The first set of configuration settings may only be set to values of &quot;true&quot; 
  or &quot;false&quot;. The remaining configuration settings contain varying types 
  of information, such as file paths or application keys. </p>
<p>In practice, it can be useful to keep several different configuration files, 
  and swap them in as needed (by placing them in the jSongMiner run directory 
  and naming them &quot;jSongMinerConfigs.xml&quot;).</p>
<p>It is possible to temporarily override some of the configuration settings using 
  certain command line flags. For example, using the -saveacexmlfile flag will 
  override the package_song_artist_album, save_output_as_ace_xml, songs_save_directory, 
  artists_save_directory and albums_save_directory configuration settings. However, 
  such command line overrides only affect the processing for the single task for 
  which they are run, and do not permanently change any of the settings in the 
  configuration file. More details are provided in the descriptions of the individual 
  configuration settings below, as well as in the <a href="03_command_line_arguments.html">section 
  of the manual on command line arguments</a>.</p>
<p> <strong>THE TRUE/FALSE CONFIGURATION SETTINGS</strong></p>
<p>The following is an explanation of the first set of configuration settings, 
  each of which may only have a value of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. 
  Any value other than &quot;true&quot;, ignoring case, will be interpreted as 
  meaning &quot;false&quot;:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>identify_only:</strong> If this is set to true, then the only metadata 
    that is saved for each song is the song title, artist name, album title, unique 
    identifier (e.g. from the Echo Nest or from Last.FM) and, if it is a file 
    being identified, the path of the file. This overrides other configuration 
    settings. If this setting is set to false, then all metadata that can be accessed 
    (in this case under the constraints of the other configuration settings) is 
    saved.</li>
  <li><strong>package_song_artist_album: </strong>Whether or not to package extracted 
    song, artist and album metadata into a single file. If this is true, then 
    a single ACE XML and/or text file will be output for each song, and it will 
    contain all extracted metadata associated with the song, the artist and the 
    album. If this is set to false, then a separate ACE XML and/or text file will 
    be output each for the song, artist and album metadata corresponding to the 
    song under consideration. Note, however, that artist and album metadata may 
    not be extracted for any given song, depending on the reextract_known_artist_metadata 
    and reextract_known_album_metadata configuration settings and on the extraction 
    history. If artist and/or album metadata is not extracted for a song, then 
    a corresponding file will not be generated if this package_song_artist_album 
    setting is false, and the single generated file will not contain the corresponding 
    metadata if this package_song_artist_album setting is true. Note that this 
    setting may be overridden by certain command line settings.</li>
  <li><strong>reextract_known_artist_metadata: </strong>Whether or not to reextract 
    metadata for the artist associated with the song being processed even if metadata 
    has already been extracted for this artist during the processing of a previous 
    song. If this configuration setting is set to false, then the artists already 
    accessed log file is checked before extracting artist metadata for the song 
    currently being processed, and metadata for the artist is only extracted if 
    it has not already been extracted during the processing of a previous song. 
    If this configuration setting is set to true, then any existing artist log 
    file is deleted and metadata for the artist associated with the given song 
    is extracted, regardless of whether it has already been extracted previously.</li>
  <li><strong>reextract_known_album_metadata: </strong>Whether or not to reextract 
    metadata for the album associated with the song being processed even if metadata 
    has already been extracted for this album during the processing of a previous 
    song. If this configuration setting is set to false, then the albums already 
    accessed log file is checked before extracting album metadata for the song 
    currently being processed, and metadata for the album is only extracted if 
    it has not already been extracted during the processing of a previous song. 
    If this configuration setting is set to true, then any existing album log 
    file is deleted and metadata for the album associated with the given song 
    is extracted, regardless of whether it has already been extracted previously.</li>
  <li><strong>include_unqualified_dublin_core:</strong> Whether or not to produce 
    metadata labeled with unqualified Dublin Core tags by interpreting extracted 
    metadata. Note that this will cause metadata to be stored redundantly if qualified 
    Dublin Core or other metadata are saved as well. If the package_song_artist_album 
    configuration setting is set to true, then unqualified Dublin Core tags will 
    only be generated for the song metadata, and not for the artist or album metadata. 
    If the package_song_artist_album configuration setting is set to false, then 
    unqualified Dublin Core fields will be added to each of the song, artist and 
    album files, as appropriate. Note that, as is often the case when dealing 
    with the unqualified Dublin Core standard, the precise meaning of each unqualified 
    Dublin Core tag will vary based on the metadata that is available for each 
    given resource.</li>
  <li><strong>include_qualified_dublin_core:</strong> Whether or not to produce 
    metadata labeled with qualified Dublin Core tags by interpreting extracted 
    metadata. Note that this will cause metadata to be stored redundantly if unqualified 
    Dublin Core or other metadata are saved as well.</li>
  <li><strong>include_other_metadata_with_dublin_core: </strong>Whether or not 
    to include all extracted metadata in the saved metadata when Dublin Core tags 
    are being saved. If either the include_unqualified_dublin_core or include_qualified_dublin_core 
    configuration settings are set to true, then all metadata that is not stored 
    in a Dublin Core tag is not saved unless this include_other_metadata_with_dublin_core 
    setting is set to true. If it is set to true, then all of the available metadata 
    will be saved in its original form, in addition to in the Dublin Core tagged 
    data, which will result in some redundancy. This setting has no effect if 
    both the include_unqualified_dublin_core and include_qualified_dublin_core 
    settings are set to false.</li>
  <li><strong>enable_echo_nest_fingerprinting:</strong> Whether or not Echo Nest 
    fingerprinting is to be performed in order to derive the Echo Nest identifier 
    for an unknown song. Note that, based on the save_echo_nest_metadata configuration 
    setting, other Echo Nest web services may still be used even if fingerprinting 
    is deactivated here.</li>
  <li><strong>save_echo_nest_metadata: </strong>Whether or not to extract and 
    save metadata from Echo Nest web services. Note that this setting does not 
    affect whether or not Echo Nest web services are used for the purpose of identifying 
    a track, it only affects whether or not other metadata is extracted from the 
    Echo Nest once a track has been identified.</li>
  <li><strong>enable_last_fm_fingerprinting: </strong>Whether or not Last.FM fingerprinting 
    is to be performed in order to derive the Last.FM identifier for an unknown 
    song. Note that, based on the save_last_fm_metadata configuration setting, 
    other Last.FM web services may still be used even if fingerprinting is deactivated 
    here. IMPORTANT: Note that Last.FM fingerprinting is not included in this 
    software yet, so this setting is only a placeholder for the moment.</li>
  <li><strong>save_last_fm_metadata: </strong>Whether or not to extract and save 
    metadata from Last.FM web services. Note that this setting does not affect 
    whether or not Last.FM web services are used for the purpose of identifying 
    a track, it only affects whether or not other metadata is extracted from Last.FM 
    once a track has been identified.</li>
  <li><strong>enable_embedded_metadata_track_identification: </strong>Whether 
    or not metadata embedded in an audio file is extracted in order to help identify 
    it. Note that embedded metadata will not be used if better sources of identifying 
    information are available, such as fingerprinting results or model metadata 
    specified by the user at the command line. Note also that this setting does 
    not affect whether or not embedded metadata in general is saved and/or output 
    to standard out.</li>
  <li><strong>save_embedded_metadata: </strong>Whether or not to extract and save 
    metadata embedded in audio files. Note that this does not affect whether or 
    not embedded metadata is extracted for the purpose of identifying a song, 
    it only affects whether metadata extracted from audio files is saved and/or 
    output to standard out.</li>
  <li><strong>store_fails:</strong> Whether or not to keep a record in the extracted 
    metadata of those metadata fields for which values could not be successfully 
    extracted. If this setting is set to true, then the output metadata will include 
    a record for each field that could not be extracted indicating that it could 
    not be extracted. If this setting is set to false, then fields that could 
    not be extracted for each song are simply omitted from the the metadata that 
    is output for that song.</li>
  <li><strong>url_encode_output: </strong>Whether or not to URL-encode all saved 
    metadata using UTF-8. It is strongly suggested that this be set to true, as 
    this avoids problems due to non-ASCII characters returned by the APIs accessed, 
    as well as potentially invalid XML output. This setting applies to both the 
    text files and ACE XML files saved by jSongMiner, but does not apply to output 
    sent to standard out or standard error, which are never URL encoded by the 
    software.</li>
  <li><strong>save_output_as_ace_xml:</strong> Whether or not to save extracted 
    metadata in the form of ACE XML 1.1 Classification files. This has no effect 
    on whether text output files are also generated. This setting may be overridden 
    by certain command line flags.</li>
  <li><strong>save_output_as_txt: </strong>Whether or not to save extracted metadata 
    as new line delimitted text files. Lines with odd line numbers will contain 
    metadata field labels, and lines with even line numbers will contain the metadata 
    values for the fields on the preceding lines. This setting has no effect on 
    whether ACE XML output files are also generated. This setting may be overridden 
    by certain command line flags.</li>
  <li><strong>print_extracted_metadata_to_terminal:</strong> Whether or not to 
    print extracted metadata to standard out after extraction has completed. This 
    setting has no effect on the output files generated.</li>
  <li><strong>print_current_status_to_terminal: </strong>Whether or not to print 
    status updates indicating the principal processing operations of jSongMiner 
    as they are performed. These updates are printed to standard out.</li>
  <li><strong>print_errors_to_terminal:</strong> Whether or not to print status 
    updates indicating non-terminal errors or failures that occur during jSongMiner 
    processing. Such updates are printed to standard error. Note that terminal 
    errors are printed to standard error regardless of this setting.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>THE REMAINING CONFIGURATION SETTINGS</strong></p>
<p>The following is an explanation of the remaining configuration settings, each 
  of which are to set to values other than just &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>songs_save_directory: </strong>The directory to save files holding 
    extracted song metadata to, if this is not explicitly specified at runtime. 
    This applies to output files in both ACE XML and text formats. If the package_song_artist_album 
    setting is set to true, then all of the metadata for each song will be saved 
    in a single ACE XML and/or text file in this directory, including artist and/or 
    album metadata, if available. This setting may be overridden by certain command 
    line settings.</li>
  <li><strong>artists_save_directory: </strong>The directory to save files holding 
    extracted artist metadata to, if this information is not explicitly specified 
    at runtime. This applies to output files in both ACE XML and text formats. 
    This directory is not used if the package_song_artist_album setting is set 
    to true. This setting may be overridden by certain command line settings.</li>
  <li><strong>albums_save_directory:</strong> The directory to save files holding 
    extracted album metadata to, if this information is not explicitly specified 
    at runtime. This applies to output files in both ACE XML and text formats. 
    This directory is not used if the package_song_artist_album setting is set 
    to true. This setting may be overridden by certain command line settings.</li>
  <li><strong>echo_nest_api_key: </strong>The key needed by jSongMiner in order 
    to access the Echo Nest web services. An application for an API key may be 
    made to the Echo Nest at <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/account/register" target="top">http://developer.echonest.com/account/register</a>. 
    This setting must be set to a valid value if any of the Echo Nest web services 
    are to be used.</li>
  <li><strong>echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path: </strong>The local path 
    of the Echo Nest fingerprinting codegen binary (or shell that runs it). This 
    must be set to a valid path if local Echo Nest fingerprinting is to be used.</li>
  <li><strong>echo_nest_codegen_directory:</strong> The directory holding the 
    Echo Nest fingerprinting codegen binary. This may be needed if the codegen 
    is being run via a script, but otherwise it is ignored.</li>
  <li><strong>last_fm_api_key: </strong>The key needed by jSongMiner in order 
    to access the Last.FM web services. An application for a key may be made to 
    Last.FM at <a href="http://www.last.fm/api/account" target="top">http://www.last.fm/api/account</a>. 
    In theory this must be set to a valid value if any of the Last.FM web services 
    are to be used, although in practice service is still sometimes provided even 
    if a valid Last.FM API key is lacking.</li>
  <li><strong>artists_already_accessed_file_path: </strong>The save path of the 
    log file that is used to keep track of artists for whom metadata has already 
    been extracted. This can be helpful in avoiding the wasteful process of repetetively 
    reextracting the same artist metadata for different songs by the same artist. 
    This setting may be overridden by certain command line settings.</li>
  <li><strong>albums_already_accessed_file_path: </strong>The save path of the 
    log file that is used to keep track of albums for which metadata has already 
    been extracted. This is helpful in avoiding the wasteful process of repetetively 
    reextracting the same album metadata for different songs on the same album. 
    This setting may be overridden by certain command line settings.</li>
