<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section describes how to access and install jSongMiner onto one's computer, 
  and includes an outline of some of the files and resources included with the 
  jSongMiner distribution package. This section also provides details on how to 
  set up access to certain third-party resources whose licensing requires that 
  additional steps be performed upon installation in order for jSongMiner to access 
  their functionality. </p>
<p> <strong>COMPATIBILITY</strong></p>
<p>The jSongMiner software is written in <a href="http://www.java.com" target="top">Java</a>, 
  which means that it can theoretically be run on any system that has the Java 
  Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It is particularly recommended that 
  this software be used with Windows XP or CentOS Linux, however, as it was developed 
  and tested under these operating systems. Although the software should likely 
  run perfectly well on other versions of Windows, OS X, other Linux distributions, 
  Solaris or any other operating system with the JRE installed on it, users should 
  be advised that the software has not yet been fully tested on other platforms, 
  so difficulties may be encountered.</p>
<p>This software was developed with version 1.6.0 of the JDK (Java Development 
  Kit), so it is suggested that the corresponding version or higher of the JRE 
  be installed on the user's computer.</p>
<p> <strong>INSTALLING THE JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, as will most typically be the 
  case, you may skip this section. If not, you will need to install the JRE in 
  order to run jSongMiner. The JRE can be downloaded for free from the <a href="http://www.java.com" target="top">Java</a> 
  web site. The JDK includes the JRE.</p>
<p>When the JRE download is complete, follow the installation instructions that 
  come with it in order to install it. </p>
<p> <strong>INSTALLING JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>The jSongMiner software is available at <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net" target="top">http://jmir.sourceforge.net</a>. 
  It is delivered in a zipped file, from which jSongMiner can be extracted using 
  any of a variety of dearchiving utilities (e.g. ZipGenius).</p>
<p>There are two versions of jSongMiner, namely the development version and the 
  user version. The user version contains everything needed to run jSongMiner, 
  but does not include any source code. The developer version does include source 
  code.</p>
<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves 
  extracting this directory to any desired disk location. See the section of the 
  manual on the command line for information on running the program. A file entitled 
  Manual.html is among the files extracted, and it provides useful information 
  about the software.</p>
<p>The developer version presents jSongMiner in the form of a NetBeans project. 
  Five directories are contained in the zipped distribution file:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> jSongMiner:</strong> Contains the jSongMiner source and bytecode 
    files, as well as other NetBeans project documents and general documentation.</li>
  <li> <strong>ThirdPartyJars: </strong>Contains the distributable third party 
    software used by jSongMiner. Further information is available in the licenses 
    section of the manual.</li>
  <li><strong> UtilityClasses: </strong>General jMIR classes used by jSongMiner, 
    including source code.</li>
  <li><strong> ACE:</strong> The jMIR ACE NetBeans project, including source code. 
    jSongMiner uses some classes from this software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the user and developer versions of jSongMiner make use of several configuration 
  and log files, some of which are generated at runtime, and some of which are 
  provided with the distribution. These are described below.</p>
<p>Also, regardless of whether the user or developer version of jSongMiner is 
  used, the licensing agreements of some of the third-party resources accessed 
  by jSongMiner require that additional free components be downloaded or that 
  free personal usage keys be acquired from them before they may be used with 
  jSongMiner. The following sections describe how all such software and usage 
  keys can be acquired, and how jSongMiner can be configured to use them once 
  they are obtained. Although it is certainly possible to use jSongMiner without 
  these components, it is recommended that the effort be made to acquire them, 
  as they do substantially increase the information made available by jSongMiner.</p>
<p> <strong>CONFIGURATION AND LOG FILES ASSOCIATED WITH JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>jSongMiner uses several configuration and log files, some of which are distributed 
  with it, and some of which can be generated at runtime. This section describes 
  each of these files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>jSongMinerConfigs.xml:</strong> This is a configurations file used 
    to store user settings and keys needed to access web services. It must be 
    in the same directory as the jSongMiner.jar file. A model file is provided 
    with the jSongMiner distribution, but the user will very likely want to modify 
    it before running jSongMiner, as described below. More details are about this 
    file in general are provided in the <a href="04_configuration_settings_file.html">section 
    of the manual on the configuration settings file</a>. Note that jSongMiner 
    auto-generates a default configuration file if a valid one cannot be found, 
    but this should generally be avoided, as third-party licensing constraints 
    prevent some important information from being present if when the file is 
    auto-generated (see below).</li>
  <li><strong>ENFP_Codegen.sh: </strong>This is a sample script that can be useful 
    for running the Echo Nest codegen binary under Linux with <a href="http://www.greenstone.org/" target="top">Greenstone</a>, 
    as it sets up necessary environment variables before running the codegen. 
    It is run by jSongMiner when jSongMiner wishes to run the codegen binary. 
    This script is distributed with jSongMiner, but is not needed if the codegen 
    binary can be run directly (e.g. under Windows). Users are free to write their 
    own alternative scripts, if desired, but a reference must be placed to it 
    in the echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path setting of the jSongMinerConfigs.xml 
    file (see below). Note that jSongMiner will run the script referred to here 
    such that the first command line arguments is the directory holding the codegen 
    binary, and the remaining command line arguments are the command line arguments 
    with which the codegen is to be run. </li>
  <li><strong>proxysettings.cfg:</strong> This is an encrypted file that jSongMiner 
    will auto-generate to save information needed to access the web through a 
    proxy server, if necessary. It will be saved in the same directory as jSongMiner.jar 
    if it is needed. This file is not included in the jSongMiner distribution.</li>
  <li><strong>artists_so_far.ser:</strong> This is a Java serialized object that 
    is auto-generated by jSongMiner to store identifiers for artists for which 
    metadata has already been extracted. The default is to have this file stored 
    in the same directory as the jSongMiner.jar file, but the artists_already_accessed_file_path 
    setting in the jSongMinerConfigs.xml file can be changed to select a different 
    directory (and file name). Note that the user will not need to interact directly 
    with this file, as it may be reset using various jSongMiner command line or 
    configuration file settings. This file is not included in the jSongMiner distribution.</li>
  <li><strong>albums_so_far.ser:</strong> This is a Java serialized object that 
    is auto-generated by jSongMiner to store identifiers for albums for which 
    metadata has already been extracted. The default is to have this file stored 
    in the same directory as the jSongMiner.jar file, but the albums_already_accessed_file_path 
    setting in the jSongMinerConfigs.xml file can be changed to select a different 
    directory (and file name). Note that the user will not need to interact directly 
    with this file, as it may be reset using various command line or configuration 
    file settings. This file is not included in the jSongMiner distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE ECHO NEST FINGERPRINTING CODEGEN</strong></p>
<p>With one exception, all of the third-party libraries used by jSongMiner (see 
  the <a href="09_licensing.html">section of the manual on licensing</a> for more 
  details) are distributed with jSongMiner and set up to be automatically accessed 
  when jSongMiner is run, without any intervention on the part of the user during 
  jSongMiner installation or at runtime. This one exception is the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/enmfp" target="top">Echo 
  Nest codegen binary</a>, which generates fingerprints from audio files that 
  can then be submitted to the Echo Nest's web services by jSongMiner in order 
  to identify the audio file. jSongMiner can still perform remote Echo Nest song 
  identification even without this binary, but this can be a bandwidth intensive 
  process, so it is better to use the locally installed codegen. Unfortunately, 
  licensing constraints prohibit the distribution of this codegen with jSongMiner, 
  so users must download it themselves from the Echo Nest.</p>
<p>The codegen may be downloaded from <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/enmfp" target="top">http://groups.google.com/group/enmfp</a>, 
  although users must first request permission from the <a href="http://the.echonest.com/" target="top">Echo 
  Nest</a>, which is usually freely given (note that version 3.1.2 of the binary 
  was used during development of jSongMiner 1.0). Once this is done, the ENFP 
  codegen zip may be downloaded. This will contain separate executables for Windows, 
  OS X and Linux, as well as C libraries for those who wish to use them.</p>
<p>Users must follow the installation instructions packaged with the ENFP codegen 
  in order to ensure that it is properly installed. In particular, note that the 
  codegen requires that the <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org" target="top">FFMPEG</a> 
  executable also be installed (and be made accessible on the system path) in 
  order to work. For example, under Windows, FFMPEG could be downloaded (e.g. 
  from <a href="http://www.arachneweb.co.uk/software/windows/avchdview/ffmpeg.html" target="top">http://www.arachneweb.co.uk/software/windows/avchdview/ffmpeg.html</a>) 
  and then the executable could be added to the path (e.g. C:\Program Files\FFmpeg\win32-static\bin\). 
  Linked libraries must also be placed such that they are accessible by the codegen. 
  For example, in Windows, the codegen.dll file could be placed in the same directory 
  as the codegen.windows.exe executable.</p>
<p>In practice, it may be easiest under Linux to have jSongMiner run a script 
  that sets up environmental variables and then itself runs jSongMiner, as is 
  done by the ENFP_Codegen.sh sample script described above. Whether to do this 
  or have jSongMiner run the binary directly is left to the discretion of the 
  user. Either way, information specifying the location of the codegen binary 
  (and, potentially, the corresponding script) must be entered into the jSongMiner 
  configuration file, as described below, after the binary is installed.</p>
<p> <strong>ACQUIRING ECHO NEST AND LAST.FM USAGE KEYS</strong></p>
<p>An Echo Nest API Key is needed to access any of the Echo Nest services, including 
  fingerprinting. Licensing constraints prohibit such a key from being packaged 
  with jSongMiner, however, as each user must obtain their own key. A free key 
  may be acquired from <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/account/register" target="top">http://developer.echonest.com/account/register</a>.</p>
<p>A Last.FM API Key is needed to access any of the Last.FM services. Licensing 
  constraints prohibit such a key from being packaged with jSongMiner, however, 
  as each user must obtain their own key. A free key must be acquired by first 
  creating a <a href="https://www.last.fm/join" target="top">Last.FM account</a> 
  and then applying for an API key. </p>
<p>Both of these API keys must be entered into the jSongMiner configuration file 
  when they have been acquired, as described below.</p>
<p> <strong>UPDATING THE JSONGMINER CONFIGURATION FILE</strong></p>
<p>Once the user has downloaded and installed all necessary software and acquired 
  all necessary usage keys, the next step is to set up the jSongMinerConfigs.xml 
  configuration file to take advantage of them (more information on this file 
  is available in the <a href="04_configuration_settings_file.html">section of 
  the manual on the configuration file</a>). This file can be edited with any 
  text editor. The following changes to the configuration file should be made 
  at this stage:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Echo Nest API Key: </strong>Enter the Echo Nest API key that you 
    have obtained by following the instructions above in between the &lt;echo_nest_api_key&gt;&lt;/echo_nest_api_key&gt; 
    XML element tags. For example, if your key is &quot;abc123&quot;, you should 
    enter &lt;echo_nest_api_key&gt;abc123&lt;/echo_nest_api_key&gt; for this line 
    in the configuration file.</li>
  <li><strong>Echo Nest Codegen Run Path: </strong>Enter the path to the Echo 
    Nest codegen binary (or script used to run it) in between the &lt;echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path&gt;&lt;/echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path&gt; 
    XML element tags. For example, if your path is &quot;C:\EchoNest\codegen.windows.exe&quot;, 
    you should enter &lt;echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path&gt;C:\EchoNest\codegen.windows.exe&lt;/echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path&gt; 
    for this line in the configuration file.</li>
  <li><strong>Echo Nest Codegen Directory:</strong> Enter the path of the directory 
    holding the Echo Nest codegen directory in between the &lt;echo_nest_codegen_directory&gt;&lt;/echo_nest_codegen_directory&gt; 
    XML element tags. This is only necessary if a script is being used to run 
    the binary, and this setting is ignored by jSongMiner if the binary itself 
    is specified in the echo_nest_fingerprinting_codegen_run_path setting above. 
    For example, if the binary is run by a script and the binary is in the directory 
    &quot;/home/myaccount/ENMFP/&quot;, you should enter &lt;echo_nest_codegen_directory&gt;/home/myaccount/ENMFP/&lt;/echo_nest_codegen_directory&gt; 
    for this line in the configuration file.</li>
  <li><strong>Last.FM API Key:</strong> Enter the Last.FM API key that you have 
    obtained by following the instructions above in between the &lt;last_fm_api_key&gt;&lt;/last_fm_api_key&gt; 
    XML element tags. For example, if your key is &quot;abc123&quot;, you should 
    enter &lt;last_fm_api_key&gt;abc123&lt;/last_fm_api_key&gt; for this line 
    in the configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it was not possible to obtain the codegen and/or the the API keys, then 
  it will be best to disable the corresponding services in the jSongMiner configurations 
  file. For example, if a Last.FM API key could not be acquired for some reason, 
  then the enable_last_fm_fingerprinting and save_last_fm_metadata settings should 
  both be set to &quot;false&quot; in the configuration file. jSongMiner will 
  still run properly even if this is not done, but this will avoid error messages 
  indicating that the services could not be accessed.</p>
<p>The user will observe that there are many other settings that can be changed 
  in the configuration file. The user may wish to change these now, or may wish 
  to experiment with them later. Explanations of each of the settings are provided 
  in the section of the manual on the configuration file.</p>
<p><strong> RUNNING JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>Once the installation instructions provided above have been completed, the 
  user may then run jSongMiner. Instructions on how to run jSongMiner are included 
  in the <a href="03_command_line_arguments.html">section of the manual on the 
  jSongMiner command line arguments</a>.</p>
