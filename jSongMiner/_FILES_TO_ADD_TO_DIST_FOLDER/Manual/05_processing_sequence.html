<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section provides an overview of each of the major processing steps performed 
  by jSongMiner during its operation, in the sequence that they occur. Many of 
  these steps are influenced by <a href="03_command_line_arguments.html">command 
  line arguments</a> entered at runtime, and by the settings in the jSongMiner 
  <a href="04_configuration_settings_file.html">configuration file</a>, so readers 
  should familiarize themselves with these sections of the manual.</p>
<p>This section only describes the processing associated with jSongMiner's central 
  mode of operation, which is to say the identification of songs and the extraction 
  of metadata associated with them. As noted in the <a href="03_command_line_arguments.html">section 
  of this manual on command line arguments</a>, jSongMiner can also perform several 
  additional utility functions, which are not described in this section of the 
  manual.</p>
<p>More details on all aspects of jSongMiner's operation are available in the 
  jSongMiner Javadocs and in the code itself. Readers exploring the code may wish 
  to begin with the Main class, which specifies each of the major tasks performed 
  by jSongMiner. The methods of the MainMethods class provide more details on 
  each of the tasks performed by jSongMiner. The remaining classes contain still 
  more detailed information on jSongMiner's data structures and processing. The 
  code structure is outlined in more detail in the <a href="08_class_structure.html">section 
  of the manual on jSongMiner's class structure</a>.</p>
<p><strong> JSONGMINER'S PROCESSING SEQUENCE</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li> Processing variables are initialized. Of particular interest, the song_metadata, 
    artist_metadata and album_metadata collections are initialized to hold sets 
    of MusicMetaData objects corresponding to, respectively, metadata about songs, 
    artists and albums. Each MusicMetaData object holds a single piece of metadata, 
    including the field identifier, the metadata value and the source from which 
    the metadata was derived. The song_metadata, artist_metadata and album_metadata 
    collections thus each hold a list of pieces of metadata relevant to the song 
    currently being processed, or the artist or album associated with it. Pieces 
    of metadata are added to these collections as they are extracted.</li>
  <li> The command line arguments are parsed and validated. Execution is terminated 
    with an explanatory message if they are invalid. If they are valid, then the 
    relevant information in them is stored. In particular, if any of the audio 
    file path, song title, artist name or album title are specified at the command 
    line, then this information is stored in song_metadata.</li>
  <li> If the user has elected to perform one of jSongMiner's terminal utility 
    functions (e.g. ACE XML to text translation), then the utility task is performed 
    and execution terminates.</li>
  <li> The jSongMiner configuration file is parsed, and its settings are stored. 
    If a valid configuration file cannot be found, then one containing default 
    settings is auto-generated.</li>
  <li> The configuration settings that were parsed from the configuration file 
    are modified, if appropriate, based on the command line arguments. These changes 
    are temporary, and only apply to the processing of the song currently under 
    consideration. They are not saved in the configuration file itself.</li>
  <li> Any existing log files indicating artists and/or albums for whom metadata 
    has already been extracted are deleted if the command line arguments indicate 
    that they should be. This means that artist and/or album metadata will be 
    extracted for the song being processed, even if metadata for the given artist 
    and/or album has already been extracted.</li>
  <li> A check is performed to see if it will be necessary to access web services 
    through a proxy server. If this will be necessary, then the system looks for 
    an encrypted proxysettings.cfg settings file containing the settings needed 
    to access the web through the proxy server. If this file is found and its 
    settings are valid, then the JRE is configured to route all web traffic through 
    the proxy server. If not, the user is presented with a GUI panel allowing 
    them to specify the necessary information, which may be saved in an encrypted 
    file so that it will not be necessary to enter this information again. This 
    process is repeated until settings are entered that enable web access via 
    the proxy server, or until the user cancels this operation.</li>
  <li> The log files indicating the artists and albums for whom metadata has already 
    been extracted are parsed, if they are available. If they are not available, 
    or if the configuration settings indicate that they should be reconstructed, 
    then new empty data structures are generated for logging artists and/or for 
    albums.</li>
  <li> Embedded metadata (e.g. the contents of the ID3 tags of an MP3 file) are 
    extracted from the audio file to be processed. This is only done if the configuration 
    settings permit it and if an audio file path is provided in the command line 
    arguments. The results are stored in the emb_miner variable, which holds an 
    EmbeddedTagMiner object containing embedded metadata extracted from an audio 
    file. Embedded metadata can be extracted only from file types supported by 
    the third-party Jaudiotagger library, namely MP3, MP4 (MP4, M4a and M4p), 
    Ogg Vorbis, FLAC and WMA. There is also limited support for WAV and Real Audio.</li>
  <li> The identifying_title, identifying_artist and identifying_album variables 
    are set. These key variables indicate, respectively, the most reliable song 
    title, artist name and album title currently available. These are used as 
    the common identifying information linking the various sources of information 
    accessed by jSongMiner, such as the Echo Nest and Last.FM. At this stage, 
    these fields are set to the values specified at the command line. If values 
    are not specified at the command line, then they are set to the values of 
    the associated metadata embedded in the audio file. If neither of these sources 
    of information are available, then the variables are set to null for now.</li>
  <li> If Echo Nest usage (either fingerprinting or general metadata extraction) 
    is enabled in the configuration settings, then the en_miner variable is initialized 
    with the Echo Nest API key set in the configuration settings. en_miner contains 
    an EchoNestMiner object configured to perform fingerprinting using the Echo 
    Nest and to extract metadata using Echo Nest web services. </li>
  <li> If Echo Nest fingerprinting is enabled in the configuration settings, then 
    the system attempts to find the Echo Nest song ID of the song under consideration. 
    If an audio file is available, then the software attempts to extract a fingerprint 
    by first running a locally installed Echo Nest codegen and then submitting 
    this fingerprint to the Echo Nest web services in order to obtain the Echo 
    Nest song ID. If this fails, then the audio itself is submitted to the Echo 
    Nest for remote fingerprinting, again in an effort to acquire the Echo Nest 
    song ID. If this fails, then the identifying_title and identifying_artist 
    data is sent to the Echo Nest in order to attempt to obtain the Echo Nest 
    song ID using metadata-based identification.</li>
  <li> If either local or remote Echo Nest fingerprinting succeed, then the contents 
    of the identifying_title and identifying_artist variables are overwritten 
    with the title and artist name associated with the extracted Echo Nest song 
    ID. The identifying_album variable is set to null in this eventuality, in 
    case the embedded or model metadata was wrong and would thus cause an inconsistency 
    (the Echo Nest API does not provide album-related information at the time 
    of this writing).</li>
  <li> If Last.FM usage (either identification or general metadata extraction) 
    is enabled in the configuration setting, then the lfm_miner variable is initialized 
    with the Last.FM API key (as set in the configuration settings), as well as 
    with the current values of the identifying_title and identifying_artist variables. 
    Note that if general Last.FM metadata extraction is disabled in the configuration 
    settings, but Last.FM identification is enabled, then Last.FM identification 
    is only performed if an Echo Nest song ID was not found in the preceding step 
    of processing. The fm_miner variable, if used, holds a LastFMMiner object 
    that is set up to access Last.FM web services. A LastFMMiner object always 
    holds information associated with one and only one song (unlike EchoNestMiner 
    objects, where this is not always the case).</li>
  <li> If the lfm_miner object is successfully initialized, this means that it 
    now holds information associated with a song. The identifying_title, identifying_artist 
    and identifying_album variables are then set based on the results, but only 
    if they are null just prior to Last.FM identification. In other words, identifying 
    information provided by the Echo Nest, command line arguments and embedded 
    metadata take precedence, in that order. If the lfm_miner object could not 
    be successfully initialized, this means that either the Last.FM API key in 
    the configuration settings is invalid or that a song could not be found that 
    matches the identifying data provided. If lfm_miner is null at this point, 
    then no more processing is performed using Last.FM services for this song.</li>
  <li> If Echo Nest fingerprinting is not permitted, but saving of general Echo 
    Nest derived metadata is, and identifying information is now available from 
    some other source (e.g. Last.FM), then a metadata-based Echo Nest query is 
    attempted in order to find an Echo Nest song ID.</li>
  <li> If none of the methods that attempted to identify the track succeeded, 
    then execution is terminated, as it is not possible to extract further metadata 
    without identifying information.</li>
  <li> If the configuration settings indicate that only identifying information 
    is to be extracted, then this information is stored in song_metadata. Execution 
    then skips to the removal of empty metadata stage described below.</li>
  <li> If the configuration settings indicate that general Echo Nest metadata 
    extraction is to be performed, and an Echo Nest song ID was found in the previous 
    steps, then Echo Nest metadata is extracted and saved for the song being processed 
    in the song_metadata variable. Metadata acquired during the fingerprinting 
    process, if any, is also added to song_metadata at this stage. If the logs 
    of artists for which metadata has previously been extracted do not indicate 
    that metadata has already been extracted for the artist associated with the 
    song currently being processed, then metadata is also extracted for the artist 
    and added to the artist_metadata variable.</li>
  <li> If the configuration settings indicate that general Last.FM metadata extraction 
    is to be performed, and the lfm_miner variable was successfully set to a LastFMMiner 
    object associated with a particular song in the previous steps, then Last.FM 
    metadata is extracted and saved for the song being processed in the song_metadata 
    variable. If the logs of artists and albums for which metadata has previously 
    been extracted do not indicate that metadata has already been extracted for 
    the artist and album associated with the song currently being processed, then 
    metadata is also extracted for the artist and album, as appropriate, and added 
    to the artist_metadata and album_metadata variables, respectively.</li>
  <li> If the configuration settings indicate that general metadata embedded in 
    audio files is to be stored, and a path of an audio file containing embedded 
    metadata that could be extracted was provided in the command line arguments, 
    then all available embedded metadata is added to the song_metadata variable.</li>
  <li> Individual metadata fields that could not be successfully extracted from 
    the various information sources are removed from song_metadata, artist_metadata 
    and album_metadata, if the configuration settings indicate that this should 
    be done.</li>
  <li> If unqualified and/or qualified Dublin Core field labels are enabled in 
    the configuration settings, then the metadata stored in song_metadata, artist_metadata 
    and album_metadata is processed in order to extract metadata with unqualified 
    and/or qualified Dublin Core labeled metadata, which is then added back to 
    song_metadata, artist_metadata and album_metadata. This is an inherently redundant 
    process, as all of the metadata given Dublin Core field names is originally 
    contained in the generally extracted metadata held in the song_metadata, artist_metadata 
    and album_metadata variables. Note also that unqualified Dublin Core metadata 
    is always extracted from qualified Dublin Core metadata, even if the qualified 
    Dublin Core metadata is not itself set to be saved. The meaning of the various 
    unqualified Dublin Core values may vary, depending on the metadata that is 
    available for a particular song.</li>
  <li> All non-Dublin Core-formatted metadata is deleted from song_metadata, artist_metadata 
    and album_metadata if the configuration settings indicate that this should 
    be done.</li>
  <li> If ACE XML files are set to be saved in the configuration settings and 
    command line arguments, then an ACE XML 1.1 Classifications file is saved 
    for the song metadata and, if extracted, the artist and/or album metadata. 
    The metadata for the given resource (i.e. song, artist or album) is saved 
    such that there is a single ACE XML instance for the resource. This is given 
    the data_set_id of the best unique identifier available. Each piece of metadata 
    for the resource is stored in a misc_info tag, with the source and field name 
    concatenated together and separated with &quot;: &quot; in the tag's misc_info_key 
    attribute.</li>
  <li> If text files are set to be saved in the configuration settings and command 
    line argruments, then a text file is saved for the song metadata and, if extracted, 
    the artist and/or album metadata. Each odd line is a field identifier and 
    each even line is the value for the field named on the preceding line.</li>
  <li> The following notes apply to both ACE XML and text files saved in the two 
    steps outlined above: The field name and field value for each piece of metadata 
    may be URL encoded, depending on the configuration settings. Depending on 
    command line and configuration settings, the song, artist and album metadata 
    could all be packaged into one file, or the song, artist and album metadata 
    could each be saved in a separate file. In the former case, metadata duplicates 
    (i.e. sharing the same source, field identifier and value) are removed. The 
    location of the saved file(s) depends on the command line arguments and configuration 
    settings. The default is to save each file in a directory specified in the 
    configuration file. By default, each file is auto-named based on the extracted 
    metadata (e.g., for songs, based on Echo Nest Song ID, if available, then 
    Music Brainz ID, then Last.FM Track URL, then song title, etc.). If a file 
    with the auto-generated name already exists in the save directory, then an 
    underscore and number are appended to the file name in order to avoid overwriting 
    the original file. This behaviour can be overruled by command line flags, 
    however, such that a new single directory is specified for output of song, 
    artist and album metadata, or a file path including file name is specified. 
  </li>
  <li> The logs of artists and albums already extracted are updated and saved 
    as Java serialized objects. The identifiers saved are the values of the identifying_artist 
    and identifying_album in lowercase.</li>
  <li> All extracted metadata is print to standard out, if appropriate given the 
    configuration settings.</li>
  <li> Execution terminates. </li>
