<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section provides an introduction to and overview of jSongMiner. It also 
  highlights the particular advantages of jSongMiner, and outlines the contents 
  of each chapter of the jSongMiner manual. </p>
<p> <strong>INTRODUCTION TO JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p>jSongMiner is a software package for auto-identifying songs and extracting 
  metadata about them from various sources on the web and elsewhere. This software 
  was originally designed for use in the context of digital libraries, but it 
  can certainly be adopted for other purposes as well. For example, it could be 
  used as a means of obtaining cultural features for automatic music classification, 
  or even for annotating personal music collections. For those users who do wish 
  to use jSongMiner in the context of a digital library, it has been designed 
  specifically to be integrated with the <a href="http://www.greenstone.org/" target="top">Greenstone 
  digital library software</a>, and Greenstone modules have been implemented for 
  using jSongMiner to build Greenstone collections.</p>
<p>jSongMiner begins by identifying unknown audio files using fingerprinting. 
  Alternatively, it can also identify songs using metadata queries, either using 
  metadata that is embedded in an audio file or using known metadata about a song. 
  Once jSongMiner has identified a song, it can then extract metadata about the 
  song from various sources, such as from <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/" target="top">The 
  Echo Nest</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/api" target="top">Last.FM</a> 
  web services, or from miscellaneous metadata embedded in the audio file. In 
  addition to extracting metadata about songs, jSongMiner can also extract metadata 
  about artists and albums associated with songs as distinct resources.</p>
<p>Once metadata has been extracted relating to a song, artist or album, this 
  metadata can be saved as an <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
  XML</a> 1.1 Classifications file or as a return-delimited text file, or it can 
  simply be printed to standard out. Each piece of metadata extracted by jSongMiner 
  includes the metadata field label, the metadata value and the source from which 
  the metadata was derived. Users can also opt to have the extracted metadata 
  presented using unqualified or qualified Dublin Core tags, if desired.</p>
<p>In all, jSongMiner can extract over 100 song, artist and album fields. Many 
  of these fields can have multiple values (e.g. there may be multiple songs similar 
  to a given song).</p>
<p>jSongMiner is part of the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net" target="top">jMIR</a> 
  project, and as such can be easily integrated with other jMIR applications. 
  However, it is also designed to be used entirely independently if desired.</p>
<p>Like the rest of jMIR, jSongMiner is open-source and available for free. It 
  is implemented in Java in order to maximize cross-platform utilization. The 
  one exception to this is its use of the Echo Nest fingerprinting codegen binary, 
  but the Echo Nest provides versions of this binary for use with Windows, OS 
  X and Linux. In any case, jSongMiner can certainly be used without the local 
  fingerprinting functionality offered by the Echo Nest codegen if necessary. 
</p>
<p>Since jSongMiner is designed primarily for use with digital libraries and automatic 
  music classification software, its primary users are expected to have a certain 
  basic level of computer proficiency. The majority of the interface design effort 
  has been put into providing a powerful and flexible command line and configuration 
  file interface, and a GUI has not been implemented yet. Also, some basic setting 
  of configurations must be done upon installation, due to lisencing constraints 
  imposed by some of the technologies used by jSongMiner. Having noted this, every 
  effort has been made to make jSongMiner as easy to use as possible, with ample 
  documentation in the manual, so even users with only moderate computer backgrounds 
  should still have little difficulty using the software. In addition to including 
  a command line interface that makes the jSongMiner easy to run from other software, 
  jSongMiner also has a well-documented API in order to facilitate the use of 
  jSongMiner as a library incorporated into other software.</p>
<p><strong>ADVANTAGES OF JSONGMINER</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> jSongMiner provides an integrated and unified framework for acquiring many 
    types of metadata from diverse sources of information about music. It keeps 
    a record of resource identifiers in as many namespaces as possible while doing 
    this, thus facilitating the integration of information from different sources.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner provides several different mechanisms for identifying audio 
    files, so that if one approach fails another may work. jSongMiner also extracts 
    some of the same metadata fields from different sources redundantly, so that 
    if a given piece of information is missing or incorrect on one source, it 
    may still be correctly found on another source.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner permits metadata extraction for both unidentified audio files 
    and abstract pieces of music for which identifying information (e.g. title, 
    artist and album) is known.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner keeps track of where each piece of metadata was extracted from.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner provides a command line and configurations file interface that 
    provides users with a great deal of flexibility as to what they want extracted, 
    from where it is to be extracted and how the extracted results are to be presented.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner is entirely open-source and free, and is as platform-independent 
    as possible.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner has a highly extensible modular architecture that will facilitate 
    the addition of additional sources of information to the jSongMiner framework 
    in the future, as well as the incorporation of future improvements to existing 
    sources.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner is designed to be easily integrated into other software, either 
    through its very well-documented and accessible API, or through the use of 
    its command line and configuration file interface. jSongMiner also allows 
    known metadata about a song to be entered at the command line, so that information 
    known to be true by users or other software can be easily incorporated into 
    jSongMiner extraction queries.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner is designed specifically to be easily and usefully integrated 
    into digital library frameworks, and has already been incorporated into the 
    <a href="http://www.greenstone.org/" target="top">Greenstone digital library 
    framework</a>.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner provides the option of presenting extracted metadata in the 
    form of unqualified and/or qualified <a href="http://dublincore.org/" target="top">Dublin 
    Core</a> fields. It includes an original Dublin Core schema carefully designed 
    to suit the kinds of information that can be mined from the web and embedded 
    metadata tags.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner is also designed specifically to be used in automatic music 
    classification research. The integration of jSongMiner into the <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net" target="top">jMIR</a> 
    framework and its production of ACE XML files facilitate this. For example, 
    one might use the song identifiers found by jSongMiner to extract classification 
    features through the web, using software such as <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_jWebMiner.html" target="top">jWebMiner</a>, 
    or one might use the metadata extracted by jSongMiner itself directly as features.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner provides users with the option of saving extracted metadata 
    as <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net/index_ACE_XML.html" target="top">ACE 
    XML</a> or return-delimited test, and/or have it printed to standard out. 
    These choices allow the user to choose the output format that is best suited 
    to their needs (e.g. ACE XML for use in automatic classification, text for 
    easy parsing at a later date or standard out for immediate access or post-processing 
    by other software). jSongMiner also includes utility functions for use in 
    translating and quickly interpreting previously saved metadata.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner allows the storage of metadata containing diverse character 
    sets by providing the option of URL-encoding saved metadata.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner allows users to choose whether they want saved files about resources 
    for which metadata has been extracted to be auto-named with content-derived 
    unique identifiers, or whether command line-specified file names should be 
    used.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner allows users to treat songs, artists and albums as separate 
    resource types, and allows information to be extracted and saved independently 
    for each of them, whilst at the same time maintaining information outlining 
    the links between resources of the same and different types. Users also have 
    the option of instead packaging artist and album metadata with song metadata, 
    if they prefer.</li>
  <li> jSongMiner keeps logs of artists and albums for which metadata has already 
    been extracted, thus allowing users to avoid repetitively reextracting the 
    same metadata for artists and albums when a song is being processed that is 
    associated with an artist or album for which metadata has already been extracted. 
  </li>
  <li> jSongMiner allows simple access to sources of information on the web even 
    if they must be accessed through a proxy server.</li>
