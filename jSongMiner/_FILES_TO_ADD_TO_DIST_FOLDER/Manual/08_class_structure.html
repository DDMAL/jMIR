<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section provides an overview of the jSongMiner Java class structure. More 
  details are available in the jSongMiner Javadocs and in the source code itself. 
  The reader may also wish to review the <a href="05_processing_sequence.html">section 
  of this manual on jSongMiner's processing sequence</a> in order to obtain an 
  overview of how the system operates.</p>
<p> <strong>JSONGMINER'S CLASS STRUCTURE</strong></p>
<p> Each of the following classes are in the jsongminer Java package:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main: </strong>This class contains jSongMiner's executable Main 
    method, which outlines the overall chain of processing performed by jSongMiner 
    from a high-level perspective. This method primarily calls methods from the 
    MainMethods class.</li>
  <li><strong>MainMethods: </strong>This class holds static methods that are called 
    by the Main method of the Main class. These outline each of the primary processing 
    tasks performed by jSongMiner from an intermediate-level perspective. This 
    class will likely be the primary interface for those who wish to use jSongMiner 
    as a library in their own code.</li>
  <li><strong>ConfigDataAndParser: </strong>Objects of this class hold basic jSongMiner 
    configuration settings that are accessible via their public fields. Objects 
    of this class also include methods for parsing or saving these settings from 
    or to a jSongMiner XML configuration file.</li>
  <li><strong>MusicMetaData: </strong>Each object of this class holds a piece 
    of metadata, including the field identifier for the metadata, the value of 
    the metadata and the source from which the metadata value was derived. Static 
    methods are provided for processing collections of MusicMetaData objects in 
    various ways.</li>
  <li><strong>EmbeddedTagMiner: </strong>An object of this class is used to extract 
    and store metadata embedded in an audio file. Upon instantiation, an object 
    of this class is given a file path, which it stores. It then extracts and 
    stores embedded metadata from this file. Individual pieces of extracted metadata 
    can then be accessed using method calls.</li>
  <li><strong>EchoNestMiner: </strong>Objects of this class are used to identify 
    songs and extract information about songs and artists from the <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/" target="top">Echo 
    Nest API</a>. This class includes methods for identifying unknown audio files 
    using the Echo Nest's fingerprinting codegen binary and/or the Echo Nest's 
    remote fingerprinting service. There is also a method for identifying audio 
    files using known identifying metadata (e.g. song title and artist name extracted 
    from ID3 fields). Methods are also provided for extracting additional kinds 
    of information from the Echo Nest API. Each object of this class maintains 
    a private music_meta_data field that holds a vector of MusicMetaData objects. 
    Each method call to an EchoNestMiner object gives the user the option of having 
    the data extracted by the given method be stored in this vector. If this is 
    done, then all of the extracted data to date can be accessed from this vector 
    at a later time. Information for multiple songs could be stored in this way, 
    but in practice it is best to store only information for a single song in 
    each EchoNestMiner object. Echo Nest song IDs are used as unique identifiers 
    in objects of this class.</li>
  <li><strong>LastFMMiner: </strong>Objects of this class are used to extract 
    information from the <a href="http://www.last.fm/api" target="top">Last.FM 
    API</a> with respect to a given song and its associated artist and album. 
    Upon instantiation, an object of this class is given identifying information 
    about a song, and a corresponding Last.FM Track object is downloaded and stored 
    from the Last.FM API. Further method calls to an object of this LastFMMiner 
    class can be used to extract and access further information related to the 
    song associated with this Track object. Each LastFMMiner object is associated 
    with one and only one song, so the stored Last.FM Track object itself serves 
    as a unique identifier for a given song.</li>
  <li><strong>DublinCoreInterpreter: </strong>This is s utility class containing 
    static methods for processing collections of MusicMetaData objects into <a href="http://dublincore.org/" target="top">Dublin 
    Core</a>-formatted collections of MusicMetaData objects.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>OTHER JMIR PACKAGES USED BY JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> ACE: </strong>A machine learning framework that uses metalearning 
    to perform supervised learning and classification. jSongMiner uses it only 
    to generate and interpret ACE XML 1.1 Classification files.</li>
  <li><strong>UtilityClasses:</strong> A set of utility classes providing a variety 
    of general-purpose functionality. jSongMiner uses it to perform miscellaneous 
    tasks, such as accessing the web via a proxy server.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES, EXECUTABLES AND WEB SERVICES USED BY JSONGMINER</strong></p>
<p> jSongMiner also makes use of several .jar libraries, binary executables and 
  web services. These are described in the <a href="09_licensing.html">section 
  of this manual on licensing</a>.</p>
