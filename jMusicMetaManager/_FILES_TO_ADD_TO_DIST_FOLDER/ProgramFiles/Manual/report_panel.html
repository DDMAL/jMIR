<p></p> The <em>Report Panel</em> allows the user to view reports that are generated 
  by jMusicMetaManager. The left side of the <em>Report Panel</em> displays a 
  list of all available reports, and the right side displays the currently selected 
  report. Clicking on a report on the left side will cause the corresponding report 
  to be displayed on the right side. </p>
<p>Note that all reports generated by jMusicMetaManager are HTML-based and are 
  saved to disk, so the user may view them using any web browsing software at 
  any time. In fact, such browsing software is generally better optimized for 
  rendering HTML than the <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>Core Java</a> libraries, so it 
  may be desirable to use such browsing software rather than the <em>Report Panel</em> 
  when viewing very large reports.</p>
<p>Note that only those reports that were selected to be generated in the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">Options 
  Panel reports section</a> will be available on the <em>Report Panel</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Reports That Can be Generated</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>MP3 files found that could not be parsed:</strong>. This report 
    lists all files with an MP3 extension that were found in the directory specified 
    in the <em>Browse MP3 Directory </em>text field of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a> (or its subdirectories) whose ID3 tags could not be parsed. It should 
    be noted that jMusicMetaManager skips all such files during later processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-MP3 files found:</strong> This report lists all files in the 
    directory specified in the <em>Browse MP3 Directory</em> text field of the 
    <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> (or its subdirectories) that 
    do not have an MP3 extension. The case of the extension is ignored. It should 
    be noted that these files do not have any effect on processing, as they are 
    ignored by jMusicMetaManager other than for the purpose of this report. Only 
    the extension of the file is considered when generating this report, not actual 
    file content.</li>
  <li><strong>All recordings parsed (before merge):</strong> This report lists 
    the path, title and artist of all recordings for which metadata was extracted, 
    before any processing is performed. Two separate lists are produced, one for 
    the recordings extracted from ID3 tags and one for recordings extracted from 
    an iTunes XML file.</li>
  <li><strong>Files in iTunes XML but not at specified path:</strong> This report 
    lists each recording that is parsed from the iTunes XML file for which there 
    is no valid readable file at the specified path. No verification is performed 
    during the generation of this particular report of whether files that are 
    present are in fact valid MP3 files, as this information is available in other 
    reports. Unlike the <em>Recordings in one source but not the other</em> report, 
    this report may be generated even if the <em>Use MP3s</em> option of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a> is not selected.</li>
  <li><strong>Recordings in one source but not the other:</strong> This report 
    lists any recordings that were found in the iTunes XML file but for which 
    corresponding MP3 files were not found, and vice versa.</li>
  <li><strong>Fields that do not correspond between sources:</strong> This report 
    lists any differences in significant fields in the metadata for each recording 
    parsed from the iTunes XML file and its corresponding MP3 file. It may be 
    appropriate to review this metadata to ensure that it is consistent. jMusicMetaManager 
    uses the metadata extracted from the iTunes file by default when there is 
    such a disagreement.</li>
  <li><strong>All post-iTunes and ID3 merge metadata:</strong> This report lists 
    all available metadata for each recording immediately after the metadata extracted 
    from the iTunes file and/or the MP3 files has been combined. If an entry in 
    the iTunes file contains a reference to a file with a path that is also found 
    during ID3 parsing, then the metadata from these two sources is combined into 
    a single recording. jMusicMetaManager uses the metadata extracted from the 
    iTunes file by default when there is a disagreement between the fields of 
    any two recordings from different sources with the same path.</li>
  <li><strong>All recordings post-sorting:</strong> This report gives all available 
    metadata for each recording. This report is similar to the <em>All post-iTunes 
    and ID3 merge metadata</em> report, except that the recordings are sorted 
    by title. </li>
  <li><strong>Artist breakdown: </strong>This report lists the unique names of 
    all artists found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage 
    of total recordings corresponding to each artist. The number of unique composers, 
    albums and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each artist 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown composers, 
    genres and albums.</li>
  <li><strong>Composer breakdown:</strong> This report lists the unique names 
    of all composers found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage 
    of total recordings corresponding to each composer. The number of unique artists, 
    albums and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each composer 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, 
    genres and albums.</li>
  <li><strong>Genre breakdown:</strong> This report lists the unique names of 
    all genres found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage of 
    total recordings belonging to each genre. The number of unique artists, composers 
    and albums that have at least one recording belonging to each genre is also 
    reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, composers 
    and albums.</li>
  <li><strong>Comment statistics: </strong>This report lists all unique file comments 
    found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage of total recordings 
    corresponding to each comment. The number of unique artists, composers, albums 
    and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each comment 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, 
    composers, genres and albums.</li>
  <li><strong>Artists listed by genre:</strong> This report alphabetically lists 
    all unique genres. Artists are listed under a given genre if they have at 
    least one recording belonging to the genre. Artists also have the number of 
    recordings they have belonging to the given genre listed beside their entries, 
    along with the percentage of the total number of recordings in the genre that 
    they represent. </li>
  <li><strong>Composers listed by genre: </strong>This report alphabetically lists 
    all unique genres. Composers are listed under a given genre if they have at 
    least one recording belonging to the genre. Composers also have the number 
    of recordings they have belonging to the given genre listed beside their entries, 
    along with the percentage of the total number of recordings in the genre that 
    they represent. </li>
  <li><strong>Recordings missing key metadata: </strong>This report lists all 
    metadata for those recordings that have empty title, artist, composer, album 
    and/or genre fields. A separate table is produced for each of these fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Artists and composers with few recordings:</strong> This report 
    alphabetically lists artists with fewer recordings than the number specified 
    in the corresponding <em>Cutoff (2-90)</em> text box. Artists with fewer than 
    half this number of recordings are listed in bold. A similar table many then 
    be listed immediately after, but based on the composer field instead of the 
    artist field. Note that only one of these options may be present, based on 
    the settings on the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right side of the 
    Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Exactly identical recording titles:</strong> This report lists all 
    recordings that have exactly the same title (before any processing). This 
    is useful in seeing how many versions of the same piece exist in the music 
    database. These duplicates may be identical copies of the same recording occurring 
    in different places, or they may be different versions of the same piece. 
    The <em>Probable duplicates of the same recording</em> report can be consulted 
    to detect which of these recordings are likely multiple copies of the same 
    recording. The <em>Exactly identical recording titles</em> report begins with 
    several overall statistics, followed by a list of all titles for which there 
    is more than one recording with the same name. Finally, the details of all 
    such recordings in each identical title cluster are reported.</li>
  <li><strong>Fields starting with a space:</strong> This report separately lists 
    all titles, artists, composers, albums and genres that start with a space. 
    Each such field is only listed once when multiple fields are identical. This 
    report is useful in immediately highlighting this particularly common error.</li>
  <li><strong>Albums listed by artist: </strong>This report alphabetically lists 
    each unique artist present. All albums present that have at least one recording 
    by each given artist are listed under that artist's entry. Note is also made 
    of how many tracks by each given artist belonging to the given album are present 
    in the music collection, how many total tracks the album is marked as containing 
    (cumulative for mult-disc sets, if annotated), what percentage of the total 
    tracks are by the given artist (marked in bold if not equal to 100%) and whether 
    each album is marked as a compilation.</li>
  <li><strong>Albums listed by composer:</strong> This report alphabetically lists 
    each unique composer present. All albums present that have at least one recording 
    by each given composer are listed under that composer's entry. Note is also 
    made of how many tracks by each given composer belonging to the given album 
    are present in the music collection, how many total tracks the album is marked 
    as containing (cumulative for mult-disc sets, if annotated), what percentage 
    of the total tracks are by the given composer (marked in bold if not equal 
    to 100%) and whether each album is marked as a compilation.</li>
  <li><strong>Incomplete albums:</strong> This report consists of an alphabetical 
    list of all albums that are missing tracks, followed by a list of all albums 
    with an unknown number of tracks. In the case of multi-album sets, the total 
    number of tracks includes all tracks from all component albums, as long as 
    they all have the same name. Albums that include less than the percentage 
    specified in the <em>% Tracks Present (1-100)</em> text boxon on the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right 
    side of the Options Panel</a> of the total number of tracks that the album 
    is marked as containing are listed in bold.</li>
  <li><strong>Albums with duplicate or unknown track numbers:</strong> This report 
    consists of an alphabetical list of all albums with the same name that contain 
    more than one recording with the same track number or that contain one or 
    more recordings that do not have a track number specified. Note that some 
    albums may be inappropriately listed here in cases where two different albums 
    have exactly the same name.</li>
  <li><strong>Albums with unspecified year:</strong> This report lists all albums 
    that have one or more recordings missing year metadata.</li>
  <li><strong>Report on compilation albums:</strong> This report alphabetically 
    lists all unique albums that contain at least one recording marked as a compilation 
    or with an unknown compilation status. Albums where some recordings are marked 
    as compilations and others are not are written in bold, since all tracks in 
    an album should have the same compilation marking. An album should be marked 
    as a compilation if and only if not all of its component recordings have the 
    same value for their artist fields. A separate list is therefore also included 
    of all albums that are incorrectly not marked as compilations but contain 
    multiple artists (note that some entirely different albums sometimes have 
    an identical name, which will result in incorrect inclusion here). Another 
    list of albums that are incorrectly marked as compilations but contain only 
    one artist is also generated (some of these may in fact be compilation albums 
    that are missing all tracks by all but one artists).</li>
  <li><strong>Fields differing only in case:</strong> Entries listed in this report 
    indicate field values where otherwise identical (before any other find/replace, 
    reordered word subset or edit distance processing has been performed) title, 
    artist, composer, genre and album fields differ in case. One list is produced 
    for each of these fields. It will likely be appropriate to correct metadata 
    so that all fields that are otherwise identical also have the same case. Only 
    one sample value is listed for each cluster of results. For example, field 
    values of &quot;Reggae&quot; and &quot;reggae&quot; will result in a singe 
    value of &quot;reggae&quot; reported here. </li>
  <li><strong>Detailed replacements made:</strong> Entries in this report indicate 
    all changes that were made during all find/replace operations. These operations 
    were performed after lowercase conversion (if requested) and before edit distance 
    operations. The reported changes are cumulative. These find/replace operations 
    were also performed before any requested reordered word subset operations, 
    except for space removals, which were performed after. </li>
  <li><strong> Newly identical fields after find and replace:</strong> Entries 
    listed in this report indicate all title, artist, composer, album and genre 
    fields that were made newly identical after the find/replace operations were 
    performed. Any such occurrences are probably due to errors in the metadata 
    and should be corrected. The <em>Detailed replacements made</em> report can 
    be consulted for more information. These operations were performed after lowercase 
    conversion (if requested) and before edit distance operations. These find/replace 
    operations were also performed before any requested reordered word subset 
    operations, except for space removals, which were performed after. Only one 
    sample value is listed for each cluster of results, and it reflects all selected 
    processing performed up until the time that this report was generated. For 
    example, field values of &quot;Dr. John&quot; and &quot;Dr John&quot; would 
    result in a singe value of &quot;dr john&quot; reported here if the appropriate 
    processing preferences were set.</li>
  <li><strong> Fields with scrambled word orderings: </strong>This report lists 
    all title, artist, composer, album and genre fields that contain identical 
    words, but in any order, and where sometimes the words in one field are a 
    subset of the words in the other. For example, occurrences of both &quot;Duke 
    Ellington&quot; and &quot;Ellington Duke&quot; might be reported here. In 
    order to be listed here, two field values must have at least the percentage 
    of identical words specified next to the <em>Check word ordering </em>option 
    on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left side of the Options Panel</a> 
    (the words may occur in any order). The percentage is calculated based on 
    the field with the higher number of words, and is calculated after all selected 
    find/replace operations have been performed (except the removal of spaces), 
    but before any edit distance calculations have been performed. Only one sample 
    value is listed for each cluster of results, and it reflects all selected 
    processing performed up until the time that this report was generated. For 
    example, field values of &quot;Jackson, Mahalia&quot; and &quot;Mahalia Jackson&quot; 
    might result in a singe value of &quot;mahalia jackson&quot; reported here. 
    Processing for titles, artists, composers, albums and genres are each only 
    performed and reported if each corresponding <em>Probable Errors report</em> 
    is set to be generated. </li>
  <li><strong>Fields whose words are subsets of another: </strong>This report 
    lists all title, artist, composer, album and genre fields that contain similar 
    words, usually where the words in one are a subset of the words in the other, 
    and where the words may be in any order. For example, occurrences of both 
    &quot;The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; and &quot;The Royal Philharmonic&quot; 
    might be reported here. In order to be listed here, the two fields must have 
    at least the percentage of the same words that is specified next to the <em>Check 
    word subsets</em> preference on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a> (the words may occur in any order). The percentage 
    is calculated based on the field with the lower number of words, and is calculated 
    after all selected find/replace operations have been performed (except the 
    removal of spaces), but before any edit distance calculations have been performed. 
    Note that items that might have otherwise been listed here may be included 
    in the Fields with scrambled word orderings report instead if this report 
    is also set to be generated. Only one sample value is listed for each cluster 
    of results, and it reflects all selected processing performed up until the 
    time that this report was generated. For example, field values of &quot;Duke 
    Ellington and His Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Duke Ellington&quot; will result 
    in a singe value of &quot;duke ellington&quot; reported here. Processing for 
    titles, artists, composers, albums and genres are each only performed and 
    reported if each corresponding <em>Probable Errors report</em> is set to be 
    generated.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit distances:</strong> This report lists the edit distances between 
    all pairs of values in each of the title, artist, composer, album and genre 
    fields. One table is generated for each type of field. Each cell in a table 
    contains up to three values, depending on the preferences selected by the 
    user on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left side of the Options 
    Panel</a>. These are (in the following order): absolute edit distance, proportional 
    edit distance and subset edit distance. Absolute edit distance is the basic 
    Levenshtein distance. Proportional edit distance is the absolute edit distance 
    divided by the length of the longer string, expressed as a percentage. Subset 
    edit distance is the absolute edit distance minus the difference in lengths 
    of the strings, all divided by the length of the shorter string and expressed 
    as a percentage. Distances in bold on the table fall below the thresholds 
    set by the user in the preferences. Entries consisting of a hyphen indicate 
    one or both of the field values are unknown, so the edit distance cannot be 
    calculated. All edit distance calculations are performed on fields after any 
    selected find/replace and/or reordered word subset operations have been performed 
    and any resulting merging of fields has occurred. Processing for titles, artists, 
    composers, albums and genres are each only performed and reported if each 
    corresponding <em>Probable Errors</em> report is set to be generated.</li>
  <li><strong>Filtered candidate duplicate recordings:</strong> This report lists 
    all recordings that were found to have similar titles, but were rejected as 
    being duplicates of other recordings because of the selected filters (similar 
    duration, identical artist, identical composer, one or more identical genres 
    and/or different albums). The similarity of titles is assessed after all selected 
    find/replace, reordered word subset and/or edit distance operations are performed, 
    but no such operations are applied to any other fields for the purposes of 
    this report. Each cluster of similar titles where one or more candidate duplicates 
    were filtered out is listed, and each such listing includes either one or 
    two tables. The first table, which is always present, lists recordings that 
    were not found to be duplicates of any other recordings in the cluster. The 
    second table lists all recordings in the cluster, if any, that were in fact 
    found to be duplicates of one or more other recordings in the cluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable duplicates of the same recording:</strong> This report 
    lists recordings that are likely to be redundant duplicates of the same recording. 
    First, all recordings whose title fields are judged to be similar after any 
    selected find/replace, reordered word subset and edit distance processing 
    are grouped together into clusters. Then the filters selected in the <em>Duplicate 
    Recording Detection Settings</em> section of the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a> are applied to each such cluster. Specifically, 
    recordings are filtered out of each cluster unless they have similar durations, 
    have the same value for their artist fields, have the same value for their 
    composer fields, share at least one genre and/or have different values for their 
    album fields. Note that no processing is performed on artist, composer, genre 
    or album fields as far as the generation of this report itself is concerned. 
    Each cluster may be broken into further clusters during this processing, if 
    appropriate. Each cluster with more than one surviving recording is then reported. 
    It may be appropriate to delete some of these multiples for the sake of removing 
    redundancy in the music collection. Note that some false errors may be reported 
    here, as the system is biased under the default settings towards catching 
    all true errors. Large clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing 
    extremely large collections. Such clusters may be ignored by the user, or 
    he or she may wish to change the extraction parameters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable errors in title field:</strong> This report lists probable 
    errors in the title field of the input music database's metadata. Each cluster 
    listed indicates a set of several differing yet similar values for the title 
    field that are found in the music database. The values found in each cluster 
    should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors should be reviewed 
    and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. Some clusters 
    may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the same as the others. 
    This is a result of processing that generally errs on the side of reporting 
    false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of the possible transformations 
    that could make them the same are also listed. Only a subset of the necessary 
    find/replace operations may be listed. Additional metadata for each recording 
    in each cluster is also listed. Probable errors reported here were all discovered 
    as a result of the find/replace, reordered word subset and/or edit distance 
    processing that was selected and performed. Note that some false errors may 
    be reported here, as the system is biased under the default settings towards 
    catching all true errors. Large clusters of false errors sometimes form when 
    processing extremely large collections. Such clusters may be ignored by the 
    user, or he or she may wish to change the extraction parameters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable errors in artist field: </strong>This report lists probable 
    errors in the artist field of the input music database's metadata. Each table 
    listed indicates a cluster of several differing yet similar values for the 
    artist field that are found in the music database. The values found in each 
    cluster should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors should 
    be reviewed and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. 
    Some clusters may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the 
    same as the others. This is a result of processing that generally errs on 
    the side of reporting false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of 
    the possible transformations that could make them the same are also listed. 
    Only a subset of the necessary find/replace operations may be listed. Probable 
    errors reported here were all discovered as a result of the find/replace, 
    reordered word subset and/or edit distance processing that was selected and 
    performed. Note that some false errors may be reported here, as the system 
    is biased under the default settings towards catching all true errors. Large 
    clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing extremely large collections. 
    Such clusters may be ignored by the user, or he or she may wish to change 
    the extraction parameters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable errors in composer field: </strong> This report lists probable 
    errors in the composer field of the input music database's metadata. Each 
    table listed indicates a cluster of several differing yet similar values for 
    the composer field that are found in the music database. The values found 
    in each cluster should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors 
    should be reviewed and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. 
    Some clusters may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the 
    same as the others. This is a result of processing that generally errs on 
    the side of reporting false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of 
    the possible transformations that could make them the same are also listed. 
    Only a subset of the necessary find/replace operations may be listed. Probable 
    errors reported here were all discovered as a result of the find/replace, 
    reordered word subset and/or edit distance processing that was selected and 
    performed. Note that some false errors may be reported here, as the system 
    is biased under the default settings towards catching all true errors. Large 
    clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing extremely large collections. 
    Such clusters may be ignored by the user, or he or she may wish to change 
    the extraction parameters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable errors in album field: </strong>This report lists probable 
    errors in the album field of the input music database's metadata. Each table 
    listed indicates a cluster of several differing yet similar values for the 
    album field that are found in the music database. The values found in each 
    cluster should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors should 
    be reviewed and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. 
    Some clusters may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the 
    same as the others. This is a result of processing that generally errs on 
    the side of reporting false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of 
    the possible transformations that could make them the same are also listed. 
    Only a subset of the necessary find/replace operations may be listed. Probable 
    errors reported here were all discovered as a result of the find/replace, 
    reordered word subset and/or edit distance processing that was selected and 
    performed. Note that some false errors may be reported here, as the system 
    is biased under the default settings towards catching all true errors. Large 
    clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing extremely large collections. 
    Such clusters may be ignored by the user, or he or she may wish to change 
    the extraction parameters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Probable errors in genre field: </strong>This report lists probable 
    errors in the genre field of the input music database's metadata. Each table 
    listed indicates a cluster of several differing yet similar values for the 
    genre field that are found in the music database. The values found in each 
    cluster should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors should 
    be reviewed and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. 
    Some clusters may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the 
    same as the others. This is a result of processing that generally errs on 
    the side of reporting false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of 
    the reported clusters may include some genres that may in fact not be part 
    of the cluster. This is due to a minor processing anomaly when there are multiple 
    genres. Some of the possible transformations that could make them the same 
    are also listed. Only a subset of the necessary find/replace operations may 
    be listed. Probable errors reported here were all discovered as a result of 
    the find/replace, reordered word subset and/or edit distance processing that 
    was selected and performed. Note that some false errors may be reported here, 
    as the system is biased under the default settings towards catching all true 
    errors. Large clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing extremely
