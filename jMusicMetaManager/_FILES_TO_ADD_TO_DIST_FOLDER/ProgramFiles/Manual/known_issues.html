<p>This software is an open source academic research project that is under constant 
  development. As such, the software has a number of limitations and imperfections. 
  These issues and approaches to dealing with them are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Parsing iTunes XML files: </strong>In order to parse iTunes XML 
    files it is necessary for the computer running jMusicMetaManager to be connected 
    to the internet and your firewall, if any, must not block Java. This is because the nature of iTunes XML files makes it necessary 
    for jMusicMetaManager to contact <a href="http://www.apple.com" target=top>Apple 
    Computer's</a> on-line site when parsing them in order to access the needed 
    DTD file.</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing ID3 tags: </strong>jMusicMetaManager has difficulty extracting 
    ID3 tags from some MP3s. jMusicMetaManager uses the third-party de.vdheide.mp3 
    package to parse ID3 tags, and is limited by the performance of this package. 
    de.vdheide.mp3 is itself a free and open source package, and any improvements 
    made to it or to alternative packages will be incorporated into jMusicMetaManager 
    as they become available.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory utilization: </strong>Processing very large music collections 
    can require significant memory utilization. These limitations can be overcoming 
    be assigning sufficient memory to the Java virtual machine when running jMusicMetaManager. 
    Information on how to do this is provided in the <a href="running.html">Using 
    the Software</a> section of this manual. If insufficient memory is available 
    on a given computer, it may be useful to break the music collection to be 
    analyzed into separate sections, and then analyze each section individually. 
    For example, a very large collection might be broken down into separate classical, 
    jazz and popular sections, as there is unlikely to be significant overlap 
    between them. This unusual step will only be necessary when dealing with extremely 
    large music collections and when using computers with very limited memory, 
    however.</li>
  <li><strong>Displaying generated reports: </strong>Certain HTML reports generated 
    by jMusicMetaManager may be very long. Although this is not in itself a problem, 
    jMusicMetaManager displays these reports in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
    Panel</a>, which is based on the Core Java HTML renderer. This renderer can 
    sometimes be slow when displaying very large files, with the result that it 
    may be faster to view such reports with an optimized web browser such as Mozilla 
    Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. jMusicMetaManager automatically saves all 
    generated reports to the location specified in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata error detection results:</strong> The metadata error detection 
    reports generated by jMusicMetaManager and displayed in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
    Panel</a> are sensitive to the parameters specified in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>. The <a href="hints.html">Hints and Suggestions</a> section of the 
    manual can be consulted for tips on improving results.</li>
