<p>This section of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> allows the 
  user to control the parameters of the processing that will be used to detect 
  metadata errors in a music collection. These options are found on the left side 
  of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>. This section is itself 
  divided into four sub-sections:</p>
<p><strong>1) Find/Replace Settings</strong></p>
<p>This set of preferences allows the user to decide which find/replace operations 
  are to be performed as part of the process of detecting probable metadata errors. 
  All of the options in the Find/Replace section will be bypassed if the <em>Perform 
  find/replace operations</em> option is deselected.</p>
<p>One of the primary functions of jMusicMetaManager is to detect different field 
  values that should in fact be the same. As an example of how find/replace operations 
  can be useful, artist field values of &#8220;REM&#8221; and &#8220;R.E.M.&#8221; 
  should likely be identical. Having the <em>Remove all period</em>s option enabled 
  would cause all relevant metadata fields to have all periods removed, thus making 
  it possible to detect this probable error.</p>
<p>All operations in this section are performed in the order that they are listed 
  and are cumulative. For example, the <em>Convert &#8220; and &#8221; to &#8220; 
  &amp; &#8221;</em> option will convert &#8220; And &#8221; to &#8220; &amp; 
  &#8221; if (and only if) the <em>Treat upper/lower case as identical </em>option 
  is selected as well. This is because this latter option occurs before the <em>Convert 
  &#8220; and &#8221; to &#8220; &amp; &#8221;</em> option (&#8220;A&#8221; must 
  first get converted to &#8220;a&#8221;).</p>
<p>The operations in this <em>Find/Replace Settings</em> section are performed 
  before any reordered word subset operations (with one exception described below) 
  or edit distance operations selected in the <em>Reordered Word Subset Settings</em> 
  and <em>Edit Distance Settings</em> sections respectively. Find/replace operations 
  are also carried through to these two groups of processing tasks. So, for example, 
  if spaces are removed because the <em>Remove all spaces</em> option is selected, 
  then edit distances will all be calculated on field entries that have had spaces 
  removed.</p>
<p>Also, note that any field values (other than titles) found to be identical 
  during find/replace processing will be merged before proceeding to reordered 
  word subset or edit distance processing.</p>
<p>The options in this section are only relevant to the reports in the <em>Reports 
  Describing Detailed Processing Results</em> and <em>Summaries of Probable Errors 
  in Metadata</em> sections of the <a href="report_panel.html">Report Panel</a>. 
  All other reports are generated before any find/replace operations are performed.</p>
<p>These find/replace operations are performed on the Title, Artist, Composer, 
  Album and Genre fields. However, each of these fields will be excluded if a 
  <a href="options_panel_reports.html">report option</a> corresponding to a given 
  field is not selected in the <em>Summaries of Probable Errors in Metadata</em> 
  section.</p>
<p>Details on the results of find/replace processing can be viewed in the <em>Fields 
  differing only in case</em>, <em>Detailed replacements made</em> and <em>Newly 
  identical fields after find and replace</em> reports of the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
  Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Perform find/replace operations:</strong> Whether or not the operations 
    in this section are to be performed. If this option is deselected, then none 
    of the operations in this find/replace section will be performed, regardless 
    of their individual settings.</li>
  <li><strong> Treat upper/lower case as identical: </strong>Whether or not two 
    otherwise identical letters of a different case are considered to be the same. 
    This is implemented by converting all upper case letters to lower case.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove numbers and spaces at beginning of titles:</strong> Whether 
    or not all spaces and/or numbers before the first non-space and non-number 
    character are removed.</li>
  <li><strong> Convert &#8220;in&#8217;&#8221; to &#8220;ing&#8221;: </strong>Whether 
    or not all occurrences of &#8220;in&#8217;&#8221; are converted to &#8220;ing&#8221;.</li>
  <li><strong> Convert personal titles to abbreviations: </strong>Whether or not 
    the following conversions are made: &#8220;Mister &#8221; to &#8220;Mr. &#8221;, 
    &#8220;Doctor &#8221; to &#8220;Dr. &#8221; and &#8220;Professor &#8221; to 
    &#8220;Prof. &#8221;.</li>
  <li><strong> Remove all periods:</strong> Whether or not all periods are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all commas: </strong>Whether or not all commas are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all hyphens: </strong>Whether or not all hyphens are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all colons: </strong>Whether or not all colons are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all semicolons: </strong>Whether or not all semicolons are 
    removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all quotation marks:</strong> Whether or not all quotation 
    marks are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all single quotes and apostrophes:</strong> Whether or not 
    all apostrophes and single quotes are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all brackets:</strong> Whether or not all parentheses, square 
    brackets and curly braces are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert &#8220; and &#8221; to &#8220; &amp; &#8221;</strong>: Whether 
    or not all occurrences of &#8220; and &#8221; are converted to &#8220; &amp; 
    &#8221;.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all occurrences of &#8220;the &#8221;:</strong> Whether or 
    not all occurrences of &#8220;the &#8221; are removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove all spaces:</strong> Whether or not all spaces are removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Reordered Word Subset Settings</strong></p>
<p>This set of preferences allows the user to decide which reordered word subset 
  operations are to be performed as part of the process of detecting probable 
  metadata errors, as well as what parameters are to be used.</p>
<p>One of the primary functions of jMusicMetaManager is to detect different field 
  values that should in fact be the same. As an example of how reordered word 
  subset operations can be useful, artist field values of &#8220;Ella Fitzgerald&#8221; 
  and &#8220;Fitzgerald Ella&#8221; should likely be identical, as should &#8220;Duke 
  Ellington&#8221; and &#8220;Duke Ellington &amp; His Orchestra&#8221;. Reordered 
  word subset operations are useful in detecting cases where one field value should 
  likely be identical to another, but where the words in one value are a subset 
  of the words in the other and/or the words are out of order.</p>
<p>Reordered word subset operations operate by first tokenizing fields into words 
  and then performing appropriate comparisons. These operations treat each word 
  as a single unit, and cannot be used to detect errors within words. The edit 
  distance operations in the <em>Edit Distance Settings</em> section are useful 
  for this latter type of error. Having processing that treats words as fixed 
  units as well as processing that treats each character separately makes jMusicMetaManager 
  more flexible, and has been found experimentally to provide better results in 
  terms of false positives when searching for probable metadata errors.</p>
<p>The operations in this section are performed in the order that they are listed 
  and are cumulative. They are performed after all find/replace operations described 
  in the <em>Find/Replace Settings</em> section have been performed, with the 
  notable exception of the <em>Remove all spaces</em> operation, which is performed 
  immediately after the operations in this section if it is selected. Reordered 
  word subset operations are performed before any selected edit distance operations 
  in the <em>Edit Distance Settings</em> section, so any field values found to 
  be identical at this stage of processing (other than titles) will be merged 
  before proceeding to edit distance calculations. Similarly, the field values 
  processed during reordered word subset operations reflect the results of all 
  find/replace operations, and all fields found to be identical during find/replace 
  operations (other than titles) will already have been merged before they undergo 
  reordered word subset processing.</p>
<p>The options in this section are only relevant to the reports referred to in 
  the <em>Reports Describing Detailed Processing Results</em> and <em>Summaries 
  of Probable Errors in Metadata</em> sections found on the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right 
  side of the Options Panel</a>. All other reports are generated before reordered 
  word subset operations are performed.</p>
<p>Reordered word subset operations operations are performed on the Title, Artist, 
  Composer, Album and Genre fields. However, each of these fields will be excluded 
  if a report option corresponding to a given field is not selected in the <em>Summaries 
  of Probable Errors in Metadata</em> section on the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right 
  side of the Options Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Details on the results of reordered word subset operations processing can be 
  viewed in the <em>Fields with scrambled word orderings</em> and <em>Fields whose 
  words are subsets of another</em> reports found in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
  Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Check word ordering: </strong>Whether or not a check is performed 
    to see if two fields should in fact be identical, but are not because the 
    words are out of order. The <em>Min % Matches (1-100)</em> text box allows 
    the user to set the minimum percentage of words that must match between two 
    field values, regardless of order, in order for the values to be considered 
    intended to be identical. The denominator used in the calculation of this 
    percentage, unlike the denominator in the <em>Check word subsets </em>option, 
    is the number of words in the field with the largest number of words. An integer 
    between 1 and 100 must be entered in this text box.</li>
  <li><strong>Check word subsets:</strong> Whether or not a check is performed 
    to see if two fields should in fact be identical, but are not because the 
    words in one are a subset of the words in the other, and are also potentially 
    out of order. The <em>Min % Matches (1-100) </em>text box allows the user 
    to set the minimum percentage of words that must match between two field values, 
    regardless of order, in order for the values to be considered intended to 
    be identical. The denominator used in the calculation of this percentage, 
    unlike the denominator in the <em>Check word ordering</em> option, is the 
    number of words in the field with the fewer number of words. An integer between 
    1 and 100 must be entered in this text box.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Edit Distance Settings</strong></p>
<p>This set of preferences allows the user to decide which edit distance settings 
  are to be used as part of the process of detecting probable metadata errors.</p>
<p>Edit distance, also known as Levenshtein distance, is a measure of the difference 
  between two strings that is often used in information theory and computer science. 
  It is defined as the minimum number of operations needed to transform one given 
  string into another given string. A single operation can consist of inserting, 
  deleting or substituting a single character.</p>
<p>One of the primary functions of jMusicMetaManager is to detect different field 
  values that should in fact be the same. Edit distance is a particularly useful 
  way of detecting differences in spelling, due either to misspellings, as in 
  the case of &#8220;Lynyrd Skynyrd&#8221; and &#8220;Leonard Skinard&#8221;, 
  for example, or due to multiple valid spellings of names uch as &quot;Stravinski&quot;.</p>
<p>The operations in this section are performed in the order that they are listed 
  and are cumulative. They are also performed after all find/replace and reordered 
  word subset operations described in the <em>Find/Replace Settings</em> and <em>Reordered 
  Word Subset Settings</em> sections have been performed. The field values for 
  which edit distances are found therefore reflect the results of all find/replace 
  operations, and all field values (except titles) found to be identical during 
  find/replace or reordered word subset operations will already have been merged 
  before they undergo edit distance processing.</p>
<p>The options in this section are only relevant to the reports in the <em>Reports 
  Describing Detailed Processing Results</em> and <em>Summaries of Probable Errors 
  in Metadata</em> sections of the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right 
  side of the Options Panel</a>. All other reports are generated before edit distance 
  operations are performed.</p>
<p>Edit distance operations are performed on the Title, Artist, Composer, Album 
  and Genre fields. However, each of these fields will be excluded if a report 
  option corresponding to a given field is not selected in the <em>Summaries of 
  Probable Errors in Metadata</em> section of the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">right 
  side of the Options Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Details on the results of edit distance calculations can be viewed in the <em>Edit 
  distances report</em> of the <a href="report_panel.html">Report Panel</a>, although 
  it is not recommended that this report be generated for large music collections, 
  as the creation of this report can require significant time and memory. Edit 
  distance calculations themselved can certainly still be performed even when 
  this report is not generated.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use absolute threshold: </strong>Whether or not pairs of field values 
    that have an edit distance equal to or below a fixed edit distance are considered 
    to be identical. This fixed threshold of operations is determined by the entry 
    in the <em>Max (1-75)</em> text box, which must contain an integer between 
    1 and 75.</li>
  <li><strong> Use proportional threshold:</strong> Whether or not pairs of field 
    values that have an edit distance equal to or below a proportional edit distance 
    are considered to be identical. This proportional threshold is determined 
    by the entry in the <em>Max % (1-99)</em> text box, which must contain an 
    integer between 1 and 99. The proportional threshold is calculated by dividing 
    the edit distance by the length of the longer field.</li>
  <li><strong> Use subset threshold: </strong>Whether or not pairs of field values 
    that have an edit distance equal to or below a subset edit distance are considered 
    to be identical. This subset threshold is determined by the entry in the <em>Max 
    % (1-99)</em> text box, which must contain an integer between 1 and 99. The 
    subset threshold is calculated by subtracting the difference in length of 
    the field values from the edit distance, and then dividing the difference 
    by the length of the shorter field.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4) Duplicate Recording Detection Settings</strong></p>
<p>One of the primary functions of jMusicMetaManager is to detect redundant multiples 
  of the same recording. The preferences in this section make it possible for 
  the user to control the paramters of the processing used to prevent false redundancies 
  from being reported.</p>
<p>It is expected that metadata fields such as Artist, Composer, Genre and Album 
  will include multiples of the same field value. For example, all tracks in a 
  given album should have the same value for the Album field. jMusicMetaManager 
  therefore puts an emphasis on finding values of such fields that should be the 
  same but are not.</p>
<p>The situation is somewhat different for the Title field, however. Although 
  it is also important to find titles that should be the same but are not, it 
  is also important to give special attention to titles that do in fact have the 
  same name. Such duplicates could be due to different versions of the same song, 
  which might be desirable, or they could be due to identical copies of the same 
  recording, which might not be desirable.</p>
<p>It is therefore useful to further consider titles that have the same or similar 
  names rather than just merging them, as is done for the Artist, Composer, Genre 
  and album fields. jMusicManager constructs a list of all clusters of recordings 
  with the same or similar titles, and then filters them based on the settings 
  of this section. The goal of this is to report only those similar titles that 
  are close enough in specified ways to likely be redundant multiples of the same 
  recording.</p>
<p>The filters in this section are applied in the order that they are listed and 
  are cumulative. They are applied after all selected operations in the in the 
  <em>Find/Replace Settings, Reordered Word Subset Settings</em> and <em>Edit 
  Distance Setting</em>s sections have been performed. The clusters of titles 
  that are the same or likely to be the same are constructed as find/replaced, 
  reordered word subset and edit distance operations are performed. </p>
<p>The options in this section are only relevant to the <em>Probable duplicates 
  of the same recording</em> report in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
  Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Filter by duration:</strong> Whether or not two recordings with 
    sufficiently similar Title field values are eliminated from consideration 
    as redundant duplicates if they have durations whose difference is less than 
    the percentage of their lengths specified in the <em>Max % Difference (0-100)</em> 
    text box. The entry in this text box must be an integer between 0 and 100.</li>
  <li><strong> Filter by artist: </strong>Whether or not two recordings with sufficiently 
    similar Title field values are eliminated from consideration as redundant 
    duplicates if they have different Artist field values.</li>
  <li><strong> Filter by composer:</strong> Whether or not two recordings with 
    sufficiently similar Title field values are eliminated from consideration 
    as redundant duplicates if they have different Composer field values.</li>
  <li><strong> Filter by genre (at least one common):</strong> Whether or not 
    two recordings with sufficiently similar Title field values are eliminated 
    from consideration as redundant duplicates if they do not have at least one 
    Genre field value in common.</li>
  <li><strong>Filter by album:</strong> Whether or not two recordings with sufficiently 
    similar Title field values are eliminated from consideration as redundant 
    duplicates if they have the <em>the same</em> Album field values. </li>
</ul>
