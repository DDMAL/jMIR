<p> The metadata error detection reports generated by jMusicMetaManager and displayed 
  in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report Panel</a> are sensitive to the parameters 
  specified in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>. This section 
  of the manual provides tips for improving analysis results:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>False positives:</strong> jMusicMetaManager is parameterized under 
    its default settings to be biased towards detecting all present metadata errors, 
    at the cost of an increased risk of false positives. This means that a number 
    of probable errors may be reported which may not in fact be errors. Manual 
    examination of all reported errors is therefore necessary. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Large error clusters:</strong> Processing of large and diverse 
        music collections with lenient analysis parameters (such as the default 
        parameters) can result in large clusters of field values in the center 
        of the generated error reports. Although these clusters often do contain 
        correctly detected metadata errors, they usually also encompass many unrelated 
        fields. These large clusters can therefore be ignored if user time is 
        limited. These clusters are almost always a result of reordered word subset 
        processing and/or edit distance calculations with extremely lenient (much 
        more lenient than the default parameters) edit distance thresholds. The 
        best way to avoid such clusters is generally to disable reordered word 
        subset processing, although this comes at the cost of potentially missing 
        some important legitimate metadata errors that this processing could detect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Applying jMusicMetaManager iteratively: </strong>It is often useful 
    to run jMusicMetaManager several times, with corrections made after each iteration. 
    This allows the corrected fields themselves to be checked and compared with 
    the rest of the music collection. 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fields of interest: </strong>It is often useful to correct the 
        artist, composer, genre and album fields first, and save the title field 
        for iterations following the first run.</li>
      <li><strong>Modifying analysis parameters:</strong> It can be useful to 
        use different settings in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> 
        for different iterations. This is true with all parameters, but is particularly 
        important with respect to reordered word subset operations. It can be 
        best to do analysis first with reordered word subset processing enabled, 
        and then disabled in the next iteration. It can possibly be reenabled 
        once again if additional iterations are used. This is because the field 
        merging performed in these operations is by its nature insensitive to 
        word ordering, with the result that only one of multiple possible orders 
        will be used in edit distance calculations. In practice, it is often best 
        to correct any reordered word subset related errors, and then rerun processing 
        with reordered word subset processing turned off in order to make sure 
        all edit distance related metadata errors are found by the software.</li>
