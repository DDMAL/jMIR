<strong>Compatibility Issues</strong> 
<p>The jMusicMetaManager software is written in <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>Java</a>, 
  which means that it can theoretically be run on any system that has the Java 
  Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It is recommended that this software 
  be used with Windows XP, however, as it was developed and tested under the Windows 
  XP operating system, and the interface&#8217;s appearance is optimized for Windows. 
  Although the software should theoretically run under earlier versions of Windows, 
  OS X, Linux, Solaris or any other operating system with the JRE installed on 
  it, users should be advised that the software has not yet been tested on other 
  platforms, so difficulties may be encountered.</p>
<p>This software was developed with version 1.5 of the JDK (Java Development Kit), 
  so it is suggested that the corresponding version or higher of the JRE be installed 
  on the user's computer.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the Java Runtime Environment</strong></p>
<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, you may skip this section. If 
  not, you will need to install it in order to run jMusicMetaManager. The JRE 
  can be downloaded for free from the <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>java.sun.com</a> 
  web site. The JDK includes the JRE.</p>
<p>When the download is complete, follow the installation instructions that come 
  with it.
</p>
<p><strong>Installing jMusicMetaManager</strong> </p>
<p>The jMusicMetaManager software is delivered in a zipped file, from which jMusicMetaManager 
  can be extracted using any of a variety of dearchiving utilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target=top>WinZip</a>).</p>
<p>There are two versions of jMusicMetaManager, namely the development version 
  and the user version. The user version contains everything needed to run jMusicMetaManager, 
  but does not include any source code. The developer version does include source 
  code.</p>
<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves 
  copying this directory into any desired location. See the <a href="running.html">Using 
  the Software</a> section for information on running the program. A file entitled 
  &quot;Manual.html&quot; will also be extracted, which can be used to gain instructions 
  on using the software.</p>
<p>The developer version presents jMusicMetaManager in the form of a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target=top>NetBeans</a> 
  project. Three directories are contained in the zipped distribution file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>jMusicMetaManager: Contains the jMusicMetaManager source and bytecode files, 
    as well as other NetBeans project documents and general documentation.</li>
  <li>ThirdPartyJars: Contains the third party software used by jMusicMetaManager. 
    Further information is available in the <a href="licenses.html">licenses</a> 
    section of the manual.</li>
  <li>UtilityClasses: General classes used by jMusicMetaManager.</li>
