<p>jMusicMetaManager is an open source software project for automatically detecting 
  metadata errors in MP3 music collections, as well as profiling and organizing 
  collections. In particular, jMusicMetaManager places an emphasis on detecting 
  differing field values that should in fact be the same (e.g. different spellings 
  of &#8220;Lynyrd Skynyrd&#8221;) and on detecting redundant duplicates of the 
  same recording. jMusicManager can produce a total of 39 different reports providing 
  various kinds of information about music collections.</p>
<p>The jMusicMetaManager software can extract metadata (e.g. title, artist, genre, 
  etc.) from <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple iTunes</a> 
  XML files or directly from the <a href="http://www.id3.org" target=top>ID3 tags</a> 
  of MP3 files. This data can then be processed and organized in user specifiable 
  ways, with the results presented in HTML formatted reports. A special emphasis 
  is placed on the Title, Artist, Composer, Album and Genre fields.</p>
<p>jMusicMetaManager has been developed as part of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmir" target="top">jMIR 
  </a>music classification and similarity analysis software suite, and may be 
  used either as part of this suite or independently. The quality, consistency 
  and reliability of ground truth plays an essential role in the ultimate efficacy 
  of any learned model, and jMusicMetaManager was developed to help improve the 
  metadata that is used to train and test learning algorithms for music information 
  retrieval (MIR) projects. As such, jMusicMetaManager is capable of exporting 
  parsed metadata to both <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top">Weka</a> 
  ARFF and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmir" target="top">ACE</a> 
  XML files.</p>
<p>The jMusicMetaManager software is in no way limited to MIR projects, and can 
  be a useful tool for users ranging from individuals wishing to organize their 
  personal digital music collections to employees of libraries or other large 
  institutions wishing to profile their music databases.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Manual</strong></p>
<p>This manual is divided into a number of sections, as can be seen on the contents 
  bar on the left. The <a href="installation.html">Installation</a> section gives 
  instructions on installing jMusicMetaManager, and the <a href="running.html">Using 
  the Software</a> section gives instructions on how to run it. </p>
<p>The jMusicMetaManager interface is divided into two main panels, which may 
  be accessed via tabs below the <a href="menus.html">menu bar</a>. The first, 
  the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>, allows the user to choose 
  the source(s) of the metadata to analyzed, as well as the settings to be used 
  for metadata error detection and report generation. This <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a> is itself divided into two subsections, namely the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">Processing 
  Options</a> section on the left and the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">Reports 
  Options</a> on the right. The second panel, the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
  Panel</a>, can be used to examine generated reports. The <a href="menus.html">menu 
  bar</a> can be used to perform tasks such as restoring default options, exporting 
  metadata to <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top">Weka</a> 
  ARFF or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmir" target="top">ACE</a> 
  XML files, and viewing help information such as the manual.</p>
<p>A <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> is available for help in getting started 
  with the software. A section providing <a href="hints.html">hints and suggestions</a> 
  is also available to give ideas on how to use jMusicMetaManager in such a way 
  that results will be optimized, and an additional section provides a description 
  of <a href="known_issues.html">known problems and solutions</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this manual includes a section describing the <a href="licenses.html">licenses</a> 
  under which this software can be used and distributed, a section describing 
  <a href="version_updates.html">version updates</a> and a section providing <a href="contact.html">contact 
  information</a> for help requests and bug reports.</p>
