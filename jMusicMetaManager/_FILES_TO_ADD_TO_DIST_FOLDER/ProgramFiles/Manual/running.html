<p><strong>Running the Software</strong></p>
<p>A file named &quot;jMusicMetaManager.jar&quot; is produced upon <a href="installation.html">installation</a>. 
  The simplest way to start jMusicMetaManager is to double click on this file.</p>
<p>The software may also be accessed via the command line (e.g. the DOS prompt). 
  To access DOS under Windows, for example, go to the Start Menu, select Run and 
  type &quot;cmd&quot;. Then use the &quot;cd&quot; command to move to the directory 
  that contains the jMusicMetaManager.jar file. In that directory, type:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> java -jar jMusicMetaManager.jar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it should be noted that the JRE does not always allocate sufficient 
  memory for jMusicMetaManager to process large music collections. Running jMusicMetaManager 
  using either of the above two methods could therefore result in an out of memory 
  error.</p>
<p>It is therefore preferable to manually allocate a greater amount of memory. 
  500 to 700 MB should be more than enough for most situations, but one should 
  be careful to leave at least 300MB unallocated under Windows XP. If you have 
  512 MB of RAM, you should run the jMusicMetaManager software as follows at the 
  command prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> java -ms16M -mx200M -jar jMusicMetaManager.jar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have 1 GB or more of RAM, you should run jMusicMetaManager as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> java -ms16M -mx700M -jar jMusicMetaManager.jar</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Using the Software's Interface</strong></p>
<p>The jMusicMetaManager interface is divided into two main panels, which may 
  be accessed via tabs below the <a href="menus.html">menu bar</a>. The first, 
  the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>, allows the user to choose 
  the source(s) of the metadata to analyzed, as well as the settings to be used 
  for metadata error detection and report generation. This <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a> is itself divided into two subsections, namely the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">Processing 
  Options</a> section on the left and the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">Reports 
  Options</a> on the right. The second panel, the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
  Panel</a>, can be used to examine generated reports. The <a href="menus.html">menu 
  bar</a> can be used to perform tasks such as restoring default options, exporting 
  metadata to <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="top">Weka</a> 
  ARFF or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmir" target="top">ACE</a> 
  XML files, and viewing help information such as the manual. Note that your computer 
  must be connected to the internet and that your firewall must not block Java if you wish to parse Apple iTunes files.</p>
<p>A <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> is available to give a brief introduction 
  on running the software.</p>
<p><strong>Error Messages and Other Problems</strong></p>
<p>jMusicMetaManager generates informative error messages when any problems occur. 
  The reported problems can most often be resolved by following the instructions 
  in the error message. If a problem is encountered that cannot be resolved in 
  this manner, then the <a href="known_issues.html">Problems and Solutions</a> 
  section of the manual should be consulted.</p>
<p>The metadata error detection reports generated by jMusicMetaManager and displayed 
  in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report Panel</a> can be sensitive to the 
  parameters specified in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>. 
  The <a href="hints.html">Hints and Suggestions</a> section of the manual can 
  be consulted for tips on improving results.</p>
