<p>This software is under ongoing development. The changes so far are as follows:</p>

    ability to access web parsing functionality through a proxy server.</li>
  <li><strong>1.2.1: </strong>Updated UtilityClasses support libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>1.2: </strong>Includes updated support libraries (UtilityClasses and
    Xerces 2.9.1).</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>The effect of the album filter was reversed, so that 
    recordings will be reported as potential duplicates only if they are on different 
    albums when this filter is applied.</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>Tutorial, Hints &amp; Suggestions, Problems &amp; 
    Solutions, Codaich and Version Update History sections were added to the manual,

  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>Verification was implemented to ensure that the user 
    saves report files with a .html extension.</li>

    preventing some operating systems from marking report folders as busy when 
    errors occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>A bug causing the + sign to be improperly parsed 
    from iTunes files was corrected.</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>The clarity of error messages relating to the need 
    to access the internet was improved.</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>The About dialog box was updated to reflect the GPL 
    licensing.</li>
  <li><strong>1.01: </strong>The name of the Information menu was corrected.</li>
  <li><strong>1.02: </strong>All directory paths in HTML reports use a forward
