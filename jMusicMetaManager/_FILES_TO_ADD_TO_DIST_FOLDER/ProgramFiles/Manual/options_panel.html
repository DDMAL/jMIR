<p>The <em>Options Panel</em> allows the user to set the preferences and parameters 
  controlling metadata error detection processing and report generation.</p>
<p>The <em>Options Panel</em> will originally be set to default settings. These 
  can be restored at anytime by selecting the <em>Restore Default Options</em> 
  item from the <em>Analysis Menu</em>.</p>
<p>Certain settings will have an impact on other settings. As a result, any change 
  made to the <em>Options Panel</em> may cause jMusicMetaManager to automatically 
  grey out or activate certain options as appropriate. Any greyed out options 
  are not relevant under the currently selected options, and their settings will 
  be ignored unless other options are changed to activate them again. </p>
<p>This panel is divided into three sections. The top section allows the user 
  to specify the source(s) of the metadata that isto be analyzed, as well as where 
  to save the reports that are to be generated. The middle section allows the 
  user to set specific processing parameters. The bottom section consists of the 
  <em>Begin Metadata Analysis</em> button, which initiates analysis and report 
  generation based on the chosen settings in the top two sections.</p>

<p><strong>Top Section of the Options Panel - Metadata Sources</strong></p>

<p>The top section of the <em>Options Panel</em> is itself divided into three 
  rows. Each row consists of a button allowing the user to browse to an appropriate 
  disk path, an editable text field showing the current disk path and, in the 
  case of the top two rows, check boxes that allow the user to disable the matching 
  row.</p>
<p>jMusicMetaManager can acquire metadata from two possible sources, namely <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="top">Apple 
  iTunes</a> XML files or the <a href="http://www.id3.org/" target="top">ID3 tags</a> 
  of MP3 files. The first row (<em>Browse iTunes XML File</em>) allows the specification 
  of the path of an iTunes XML file. The second row (<em>Browse MP3 Director</em>y) 
  allows the user to specify a directory that will be searched, along with all 
  of its subdirectories, for MP3 files, from which metadata will be extracted. 
  The <em>Use iTunes</em> and <em>Use MP3s</em> check boxes allow the user to 
  specify which (or both) of these sources of metadata will be examined. In general, 
  iTunes files tend to be more reliable, partly because of their nature and partly 
  because the third-party ID3 parser used by jMusicMetaManager can be buggy for 
  some ID3 versions.</p>
<p>Although iTunes does not make it possible to specify multiple genres per recording, 
  jMusicMetaManager does make it possible to have multiple genres per recording 
  by interpreting occurrences of &#8220; + &#8221; in the Genre field as a delimiter. 
  So, for example, a Genre of &#8220;Jazz + Blues&#8221; in an iTunes file would 
  be interpreted as two different genres by jMusicMetaManager, namely &#8220;Jazz&#8221; 
  and &#8220;Blues&#8221;.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, if both iTunes and ID3 sources are used, and if the 
  metadata for an MP3 file corresponds to an entry with the same path in the iTunes 
  file, then the two sets of metadata will be combined together into metadata 
  for a single recording, with the metadata from the iTunes source being used 
  in the case of any fields that are both present but non-identical. The final 
  set of recordings that are analyzed will therefore consist of all recordings 
  referred to in the iTunes file but not in the given directory or its subdirectories, 
  all MP3 files found in the given directory or its subdirectories but not referred 
  to in the iTunes file, and one entry for each pair of recordings found in both 
  sources.</p>
<p>The third row of the top section of the <em>Options Panel</em> (<em>Browse 
  Report Save Path</em>) allows the user to specify where the root file of the 
  HTML report to be generated is to be saved. A directory containing further report 
  files will also be created in the same directory. The reports generated are 
  frames-based, and the root file contains the information needed to load the 
  frames. The file specified by the path in this field must have a .html extension.</p>
<p><strong>Middle Section of the Options Panel - Processing Settings</strong></p>
<p>The central section of the <em>Options Panel</em> allows the user to set analysis 
  parameters and report preferences. Note that the input to all text boxes in 
  this section must be integers and must be in the specified range, or an error 
  message will be generated. The left side of the central section contains processing 
  preferences and the right side contains preferences regarding the reports to 
  be generated. This central section of the <em>Options Panel</em> is further 
  described in the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">Option Panel Processing 
  Settings</a> and the <a href="options_panel_reports.html">Options Panel Report 
  Settings</a> sections of this manual.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Section of the Options Panel - Begin Metadata Analysis Button</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Begin Metadata Analysis</em> button initiates processing using the 
  metadata specified in the top two rows of the <em>Options Panel</em> and the 
  preferences specified in its central section. A report is saved to the path 
  given in the third row of the <em>Options Panel</em>, and may also be viewed 
  directly in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report Panel</a> once processing 
  is complete. The user will automatically be notified of any invalid settings 
  when analysis is initiated, and will have the opportunity to correct them at 
  that point before proceeding with analysis and report generation.</p>
