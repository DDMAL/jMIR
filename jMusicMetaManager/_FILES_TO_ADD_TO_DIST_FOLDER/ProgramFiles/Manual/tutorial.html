<p>This section of the manual provides a brief applied introduction on using the 
  jMusicMetaManager software.</p>
<ol>
  <li>After installing the jMusicMetaManager software (see the <a href="installation.html">Installation</a> 
    section of the manual), run it by double clicking on the jMusicMetaManager.jar 
    file or by running it from a command prompt (see the <a href="running.html">Using 
    the Software</a> section).</li>
  <li>The software will start with the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a> 
    displayed. This is where the user may choose the source of the metadata to 
    analyze, the location to save the generated reports, the parameters to use 
    in error detection analysis and which reports to generate. This tutorial will 
    assume the use of the default settings, although the user may wish to deviate 
    from these settings when actually applying the jMusicMetaManager to real situations 
    (see the <a href="hints.html">Hints and Suggestions</a> section).</li>
  <li>Note the default paths at the top of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>. A sample <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple 
    iTunes</a> file that is provided with jMusicMetaManager is the default source 
    of metadata to analyze, and the generated report root will be saved as <em>WorkingDirectory/anaylysis_output_01.html</em> 
    by default. This iTunes file can be imported into the iTunes software itself 
    if the user wishes to examine its contents. Note that no MP3 files will be 
    directly analyzed under the default settings, as no such files are provided 
    with the jMusicMetaManager installation, and all needed metadata is provided 
    by the default iTunes file.</li>
  <li>Analysis of the iTunes file can be initiated by pressing the <em>BEGIN METADATA 
    ANALYSIS</em> button at the bottom of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
    Panel</a>. A progress bar will be briefly displayed while the file is analyzed 
    using the default settings.</li>
  <li>The focus of jMusicMetaManager's GUI will automatically switch to the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
    Panel</a>, which will display the results of the processing of the default 
    iTunes file. The results will also be saved as a set of HTML files to the 
    location specified in the <a href="options_panel.html">Options Panel</a>, 
    the root of which is WorkingDirectory\anaylysis_output_01.html by default. 
    These results can either be viewed directly in the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
    Panel</a> or viewed using any web browser.</li>
  <li>The names of the generated reports are listed on the left of the <a href="report_panel.html">Report 
    Panel</a>, and the currently selected report is on the right. Clicking on 
    the name of a report on the left will cause it to be displayed on the right. 
    These reports each either provide various profiles of the music collection 
    or highlight probable metadata errors contained within it.</li>
  <li>The user should review these reports to get a feel for them and the kind 
    of information that they provide. To give just a very few examples of the 
    information provided in the reports: 
    <ul>
      <li>The software correctly notes that Charles Mingus is present as both 
        &quot;Mingus, Charles&quot; and &quot;Charles Mingus&quot;.</li>
      <li>The software correctly notes that the Borodin String Quartet is present 
        as both &quot;The Borodin String Quartet&quot; and &quot;Borodin String 
        Quartet&quot;.</li>
      <li>The software correctly notes that the track &quot;Les Bourgeois&quot; 
        by Jacques Brel is present twice, and its title is mispelled as &quot;Les 
        Borgeois&quot; once.</li>
      <li> Note that &quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; occurs twice, &quot;I 
        Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow (Instrumental)&quot; occurs twice and &quot;String 
        Quartet No. 8 In C minor Op. 110&quot; appears thrice, but jMusicMetaManager 
        correctly avoids detecting them as a redundant copies, since they are 
        different versions of the pieces.</li>
      <li>Note that several possible errors are listed in the &quot;Probable errors 
        in title field report&quot; that are not in fact errors. This is an example 
        of how false positives can sometimes be reported. They are written here 
        to show that these titles are similar, and to give the user the opportunity 
        to verify for him or herself whether the titles should in fact be the 
        same.</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
