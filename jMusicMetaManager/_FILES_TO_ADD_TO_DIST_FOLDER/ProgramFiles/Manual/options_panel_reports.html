<p>This section of options on the right side of the <a href="options_panel.html">Options 
  Panel</a> allows the user to control which reports will be generated by jMusicMetaManager 
  and, in some cases, what parameters will be used to generate them. Some of these 
  reports profile a music collection and some describe probable metadata errors 
  in it. Some reports also describe the details of how the metadata was processed.</p>
<p>Note that most reports list items alphabetically, and these alphabetical listings 
  typically list lowercase characters after all uppercase characters.</p>
<p>This section is itself divided into seven sub-sections:</p>
<p><strong>1) Reports Relating to iTunes/ID3 Parsing and Merging</strong></p>
<p>The preferences in this section control which reports are generated relating 
  to the parsing of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple 
  iTunes</a> XML file and/or the extraction of <a href="http://www.id3.org" target=top>ID3 
  tags</a> from MP3 files, as well as how the metadata from the two sources is 
  combined.</p>
<p>These reports are in general not particularly relevant to music collection 
  profiling or error checking. They are, however, useful for validating the correspondence 
  between the two sources of metadata and for helping to debug processing at future 
  stages.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List MP3 files found that could not be parsed:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>MP3 files found that could not be parsed </em>report is generated. 
    This report lists all files with an MP3 extension that were found in the directory 
    specified in the <em>Browse MP3 Directory</em> text field (or its subdirectories) 
    whose ID3 tags could not be parsed. It should be noted that jMusicMetaManager 
    skips all such files during later processing.</li>
  <li> <strong>List all non-MP3 files found:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Non-MP3 
    files found</em> report is generated. This report lists all files in the directory 
    specified in the <em>Browse MP3 Directory</em> text field (or its subdirectories) 
    that do not have an MP3 extension. The case of the extension is ignored. It 
    should be noted that these files do not have any effect on processing, as 
    they are ignored by jMusicMetaManager other than for the purpose of this report. 
    Only the extension of the file is considered when generating this report, 
    not actual file content.</li>
  <li> <strong>List all recordings parsed (before merge):</strong> Whether or 
    not the <em>All recordings parsed (before merge)</em> report is generated. 
    This report lists the path, title and artist of all recordings for which metadata 
    was extracted, before any processing is performed. Two separate lists are 
    produced, one for the recordings extracted from ID3 tags and one for recordings 
    extracted from an iTunes XML file.</li>
  <li> <strong>List files in iTunes XML but not at specified path: </strong>Whether 
    or not the <em>Files in iTunes XML but not at specified path</em> report is 
    generated. This report lists each recording that is parsed from the iTunes 
    XML file for which there is no valid readable file at the specified path. 
    No verification is performed during the generation of this particular report 
    of whether files that are present are in fact valid MP3 files, as this information 
    is available in other reports. Unlike the <em>Recordings in one source but 
    not the other</em> report, this report may be generated even if the <em>Use 
    MP3s</em> option is not selected.</li>
  <li><strong>List recordings in one source but not the other:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>Recordings in one source but not the other </em>report is generated. 
    This report lists any recordings that were found in the iTunes XML file but 
    for which corresponding MP3 files were not found, and vice versa.</li>
  <li><strong>Report fields that do not correspond between sources:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>Fields that do not correspond between sources</em> report is 
    generated. This report lists any differences in significant fields in the 
    metadata for each recording parsed from the iTunes XML file and its corresponding 
    MP3 file. It may be appropriate to review this metadata to ensure that it 
    is consistent. jMusicMetaManager uses the metadata extracted from the iTunes 
    file by default when there is such a disagreement.</li>
  <li><strong>List all post-iTunes and ID3 merge metadata:</strong> Whether or 
    not the <em>All post-iTunes and ID3 merge metadata</em> report is generated. 
    This report lists all available metadata for each recording immediately after 
    the metadata extracted from the iTunes file and/or the MP3 files has been 
    combined. If an entry in the iTunes file contains a reference to a file with 
    a path that is also found during ID3 parsing, then the metadata from these 
    two sources is combined into a single recording. jMusicMetaManager uses the 
    metadata extracted from the iTunes file by default when there is a disagreement 
    between the fields of any two recordings from different sources with the same 
    path.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) General Profiles of Music Collection</strong></p>
<p>The reports referred to in this section provide general profiles of a music 
  collection that has been parsed by jMusicMetaManager. These reports are useful 
  for providing statistics describing the makeup of music collections. Further 
  profiles are available in the <em>Profiles of Albums in Music Collection</em> 
  section.</p>
<p>The reports in this section are generated after metadata parsed from iTunes 
  XML files and MP3 ID3 tags have been merged, but before any find/replace, reordered 
  word subset or edit distance operations have been performed. Fields with identical 
  values have not yet been merged when these reports are generated, as only recordings 
  with identical file paths have been merged at the point when these reports are 
  generated.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List all recordings post-sorting:</strong> Whether or not the <em>All 
    recordings post-sorting</em> report is generated. This report gives all available 
    metadata for each recording. This report is similar to the <em>All post-iTunes 
    and ID3 merge metadata</em> report, except that the recordings are sorted 
    by title. </li>
  <li><strong>Report artist breakdown: </strong>Whether or not the <em>Artist 
    breakdown</em> report is generated. This report lists the unique names of 
    all artists found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage 
    of total recordings corresponding to each artist. The number of unique composers, 
    albums and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each artist 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown composers, 
    genres and albums.</li>
  <li> <strong>Report composer breakdown:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Composer 
    breakdown</em> report is generated. This report lists the unique names of 
    all composers found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage 
    of total recordings corresponding to each composer. The number of unique artists, 
    albums and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each composer 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, 
    genres and albums.</li>
  <li> <strong>Report genre breakdown:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Genre breakdown</em> 
    report is generated. This report lists the unique names of all genres found, 
    as well as the number of recordings and the percentage of total recordings 
    belonging to each genre. The number of unique artists, composers and albums 
    that have at least one recording belonging to each genre is also reported. 
    The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, composers and 
    albums.</li>
  <li><strong>Report comment statistics:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Comment 
    statistics</em> report is generated. This report lists all unique file comments 
    found, as well as the number of recordings and the percentage of total recordings 
    corresponding to each comment. The number of unique artists, composers, albums 
    and genres that have at least one recording corresponding to each comment 
    is also reported. The tallies listed do not include counts for unknown artists, 
    composers, genres and albums.</li>
  <li><strong>List artists by genre: </strong>Whether or not the <em>Artists listed 
    by genre</em> report is generated. This report alphabetically lists all unique 
    genres. Artists are listed under a given genre if they have at least one recording 
    belonging to the genre. Artists also have the number of recordings they have 
    belonging to the given genre listed beside their entries, along with the percentage 
    of the total number of recordings in the genre that they represent. </li>
  <li><strong>List composers by genre:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Composers 
    listed by genre</em> report is generated. This report alphabetically lists 
    all unique genres. Composers are listed under a given genre if they have at 
    least one recording belonging to the genre. Composers also have the number 
    of recordings they have belonging to the given genre listed beside their entries, 
    along with the percentage of the total number of recordings in the genre that 
    they represent. </li>
  <li><strong>Report recordings missing key metadata:</strong> Whether or not 
    the <em>Recordings missing key metadata</em> report is generated. This report 
    lists all metadata for those recordings that have empty title, artist, composer, 
    album and/or genre fields. A separate table is produced for each of these 
    fields.</li>
  <li><strong>List artists with few recordings:</strong> Whether or not the artist 
    table of the <em>Artists and composers with few recordings</em> report is 
    generated. This report alphabetically lists artists with fewer recordings 
    than the number specified in the corresponding <em>Cutoff (2-90)</em> text 
    box. Artists with fewer than half this number of recordings are listed in 
    bold.</li>
  <li><strong>List composers with few recordings:</strong> Whether or not the 
    composer table of the <em>Artists and composers with few recordings</em> report 
    is generated. This report alphabetically lists composers with fewer recordings 
    than the number specified in the corresponding <em>Cutoff (2-90)</em> text 
    box. Composers with fewer than half this number of recordings are listed in 
    bold.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Miscellaneous Reports</strong></p>
<p>The reports referred to in this section provide miscellaneous information relating 
  to a music collection that has been processed by jMusicMetaManager. </p>
<p>The reports in this section are generated after metadata parsed from iTunes 
  XML files and MP3 ID3 tags have been merged, but before any find/replace, reordered 
  word subset or edit distance operations have been performed. Fields with identical 
  values have not yet been merged when these reports are generated, as only recordings 
  with identical file paths have been merged at the point when these reports are 
  generated.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Report exactly identical recording titles:</strong> Whether or not 
    the <em>Exactly identical recording titles</em> report is generated. This 
    report lists all recordings that have exactly the same title (before any processing). 
    This is useful in seeing how many versions of the same piece exist in the 
    music database. These duplicates may be identical copies of the same recording 
    occurring in different places, or they may be different versions of the same 
    piece. The <em>Probable duplicates of the same recording</em> report can be 
    consulted to detect which of these recordings are likely multiple copies of 
    the same recording. The <em>Exactly identical recording titles</em> report 
    begins with several overall statistics, followed by a list of all titles for 
    which there is more than one recording with the same name. Finally, the details 
    of all such recordings in each identical title cluster are reported.</li>
  <li> <strong>Report fields starting with a space:</strong> Whether or not the 
    <em>Fields starting with a space</em> report is generated. This report separately 
    lists all titles, artists, composers, albums and genres that start with a 
    space. Each such field is only listed once when multiple fields are identical. 
    This report is useful in immediately highlighting this particularly common 
    error.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4) Profiles of Albums in Music Collection</strong></p>
<p>The reports referred to in this section provide general profiles of the albums 
  in a music collection that has been parsed by jMusicMetaManager, as well as 
  reports of detected metadata errors relating to track numbers, compilation albums 
  and missing year metadata. More general profiles are available in the <em>General 
  Profiles of Music Collection</em> section.</p>
<p>jMusicMetaManager uses the notion of compilation albums that is most consistent 
  with that used by <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple iTunes</a>. 
  This means that every album that contains at least two tracks with different 
  values in their respective artist fields is considered a compilation album, 
  and every track in such an album should be marked as a being part of a compilation 
  in its metadata. A greatest hits compilation of a single band, for example, 
  is <em>not</em> considered a compilation under this definition. Individual users 
  are of course free to adopt any definition of a compilation album that they 
  wish, but this is the definition used by jMusicMetaManager in its compilation 
  error checking. It should be noted that Apple iTunes places all tracks marked 
  as compilations in a special folder named &#8220;Compilations&#8221; that exists 
  at the same level as artist folders.</p>
<p>The error checking used by jMusicMetaManager also checks to see if each recording 
  has a track number as well as a corresponding number of tracks in its album. 
  Multi-disc albums are considered as a single unity by jMusicMetaManager if their 
  <em>disc number</em> and <em>discs in album</em> fields are properly set. Empty 
  values for these two fields are assumed to correspond to single disc albums.</p>
<p>The reports in this section are generated after metadata parsed from iTunes 
  XML files and MP3 ID3 tags have been merged, but before any find/replace, reordered 
  word subset or edit distance operations have been performed. Fields with identical 
  values have not yet been merged when these reports are generated, as only recordings 
  with identical file paths have been merged at the point when these reports are 
  generated.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List albums by artist:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Albums listed 
    by artist </em>report is generated. This report alphabetically lists each 
    unique artist present. All albums present that have at least one recording 
    by each given artist are listed under that artist's entry. Note is also made 
    of how many tracks by each given artist belonging to the given album are present 
    in the music collection, how many total tracks the album is marked as containing 
    (cumulative for mult-disc sets, if annotated), what percentage of the total 
    tracks are by the given artist (marked in bold if not equal to 100%) and whether 
    each album is marked as a compilation.</li>
  <li><strong>List albums by composer:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Albums 
    listed by composer</em> report is generated. This report alphabetically lists 
    each unique composer present. All albums present that have at least one recording 
    by each given composer are listed under that composer's entry. Note is also 
    made of how many tracks by each given composer belonging to the given album 
    are present in the music collection, how many total tracks the album is marked 
    as containing (cumulative for mult-disc sets, if annotated), what percentage 
    of the total tracks are by the given composer (marked in bold if not equal 
    to 100%) and whether each album is marked as a compilation.</li>
  <li><strong>List incomplete albums:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Incomplete 
    albums</em> report is generated. This report consists of an alphabetical list 
    of all albums that are missing tracks, followed by a list of all albums with 
    an unknown number of tracks. In the case of multi-album sets, the total number 
    of tracks includes all tracks from all component albums, as long as they all 
    have the same name. Albums that include less than the percentage specified 
    in the <em>% Tracks Present (1-100)</em> text box of the total number of tracks 
    that the album is marked as containing are listed in bold.</li>
  <li><strong>List albums with duplicate or unknown track numbers:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>Albums with duplicate or unknown track numbers</em> report 
    is generated. This report consists of an alphabetical list of all albums with 
    the same name that contain more than one recording with the same track number 
    or that contain one or more recordings that do not have a track number specified. 
    Note that some albums may be inappropriately listed here in cases where two 
    different albums have exactly the same name.</li>
  <li><strong>List albums with unspecified year:</strong> Whether or not the <em>Albums 
    with unspecified year</em> report is generated. This report lists all albums 
    that have one or more recordings missing year metadata.</li>
  <li><strong>Report on compilation albums: </strong>Whether or not the <em>Report 
    on compilation albums</em> is generated. This report alphabetically lists 
    all unique albums that contain at least one recording marked as a compilation 
    or with an unknown compilation status. Albums where some recordings are marked 
    as compilations and others are not are written in bold, since all tracks in 
    an album should have the same compilation marking. An album should be marked 
    as a compilation if and only if not all of its component recordings have the 
    same value for their artist fields. A separate list is therefore also included 
    of all albums that are incorrectly not marked as compilations but contain 
    multiple artists (note that some entirely different albums sometimes have 
    an identical name, which will result in incorrect inclusion here). Another 
    list of albums that are incorrectly marked as compilations but contain only 
    one artist is also generated (some of these may in fact be compilation albums 
    that are missing all tracks by all but one artists).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5) Reports Describing Detailed Processing Results</strong></p>
<p>The reports in this section describe the details of the operations that were 
  used to detect metadata errors. These reports are generally only of interest 
  to those technically inclined, as the actual errors detected are output in the 
  reports found in the <em>Summaries of Probable Errors in Metadata</em> section.</p>
<p>Processing for titles, artists, composers, genres or albums are each only performed 
  and reported if each corresponding <em>Probable Error Report</em> is set to 
  be generated.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Report fields differing only in case: </strong>Whether or not the 
    <em>Fields differing only in case</em> report is generated. Entries listed 
    in this report indicate field values where otherwise identical (before any 
    other find/replace, reordered word subset or edit distance processing has 
    been performed) title, artist, composer, genre and album fields differ in 
    case. One list is produced for each of these fields. It will likely be appropriate 
    to correct metadata so that all fields that are otherwise identical also have 
    the same case. Only one sample value is listed for each cluster of results, 
    and it reflects all selected processing performed up until the time that this 
    report was generated. For example, field values of &quot;Reggae&quot; and 
    &quot;reggae&quot; will result in a singe value of &quot;reggae&quot; reported 
    here. </li>
  <li> <strong>Report detailed replacements made: </strong>Whether or not the 
    <em>Detailed replacements made</em> report is generated. Entries in this report 
    indicate all changes that were made during all find/replace operations. These 
    operations were performed after lowercase conversion (if requested) and before 
    edit distance operations. The reported changes are cumulative. These find/replace 
    operations were also performed before any requested reordered word subset 
    operations, except for space removals, which were performed after. </li>
  <li><strong> Report newly identical fields after find/replace:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>Newly identical fields after find and replace</em> report is 
    generated. Entries listed in this report indicate all title, artist, composer, 
    album and genre fields that were made newly identical after the find/replace 
    operations were performed. Any such occurrences are probably due to errors 
    in the metadata and should be corrected. The <em>Detailed replacements made</em> 
    report can be consulted for more information. These operations were performed 
    after lowercase conversion (if requested) and before edit distance operations. 
    These find/replace operations were also performed before any requested reordered 
    word subset operations, except for space removals, which were performed after. 
    Only one sample value is listed for each cluster of results, and it reflects 
    all selected processing performed up until the time that this report was generated. 
    For example, field values of &quot;Dr. John&quot; and &quot;Dr John&quot; 
    would result in a singe value of &quot;dr john&quot; reported here if the 
    appropriate processing preferences were set.</li>
  <li><strong> Report fields whose words are scrambled or subsets: </strong>Whether 
    or not the <em>Fields with scrambled word orderings</em> and <em>Fields whose 
    words are subsets of another</em> reports are generated. The Fields with scrambled 
    word orderings report lists all title, artist, composer, album and genre fields 
    that contain identical words, but in any order, and where sometimes the words 
    in one field are a subset of the words in the other. For example, occurrences 
    of both &quot;Duke Ellington&quot; and &quot;Ellington Duke&quot; might be 
    reported here. In order to be listed here, two field values must have at least 
    the percentage of identical words specified next to the <em>Check word ordering</em> 
    option (the words may occur in any order). The percentage is calculated based 
    on the field with the higher number of words, and is calculated after all 
    selected find/replace operations have been performed (except the removal of 
    spaces), but before any edit distance calculations have been performed. Only 
    one sample value is listed for each cluster of results, and it reflects all 
    selected processing performed up until the time that this report was generated. 
    For example, field values of &quot;Jackson, Mahalia&quot; and &quot;Mahalia 
    Jackson&quot; will result in a singe value of &quot;mahalia jackson&quot; 
    reported here. The Fields whose words are subsets of another report lists 
    all title, artist, composer, album and genre fields that contain similar words, 
    usually where the words in one are a subset of the words in the other, and 
    where the words may be in any order. For example, occurrences of both &quot;The 
    Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; and &quot;The Royal Philharmonic&quot; 
    might be reported here. In order to be listed here, the two fields must have 
    at least the percentage of the same words that is specified next to the <em>Check 
    word subsets</em> preference on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a> (the words may occur in any order). The percentage 
    is calculated based on the field with the lower number of words, and is calculated 
    after all selected find/replace operations have been performed (except the 
    removal of spaces), but before any edit distance calculations have been performed. 
    Note that items that might have otherwise been listed here may be included 
    in the Fields with scrambled word orderings report instead if this report 
    is also set to be generated. Only one sample value is listed for each cluster 
    of results, and it reflects all selected processing performed up until the 
    time that this report was generated. For example, field values of &quot;Duke 
    Ellington and His Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Duke Ellington&quot; will result 
    in a singe value of &quot;duke ellington&quot; reported here. Processing for 
    titles, artists, composers, albums and genres are each only performed and 
    reported if each corresponding <em>Probable Errors</em> report is set to be 
    generated.</li>
  <li> <strong>Report edit distance values: </strong>Whether or not the <em>Edit 
    distances</em> report is generated. This report lists the edit distances between 
    all pairs of values in each of the title, artist, composer, album and genre 
    fields. One table is generated for each type of field. Each cell in a table 
    contains up to three values, depending on the preferences selected by the 
    user. These are (in the following order): absolute edit distance, proportional 
    edit distance and subset edit distance. Absolute edit distance is the basic 
    Levenshtein distance. Proportional edit distance is the absolute edit distance 
    divided by the length of the longer string, expressed as a percentage. Subset 
    edit distance is the absolute edit distance minus the difference in lengths 
    of the strings, all divided by the length of the shorter string and expressed 
    as a percentage. Distances in bold on the table fall below the thresholds 
    set by the user in the preferences. Entries consisting of a hyphen indicate 
    one or both of the field values are unknown, so the edit distance cannot be 
    calculated. All edit distance calculations are performed on fields after any 
    selected find/replace and/or reordered word subset operations have been performed 
    and any resulting merging of fields has occurred. Processing for titles, artists, 
    composers, albums and genres are each only performed and reported if each 
    corresponding <em>Probable Errors</em> report is set to be generated.</li>
  <li><strong> List filtered candidate duplicate recordings:</strong> Whether 
    or not the <em>Filtered candidate duplicate recordings</em> report is generated. 
    This report lists all recordings that were found to have similar titles, but 
    were rejected as being duplicates of other recordings because of the selected 
    filters on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left side of the Options 
    Panel</a> (similar duration, identical artist, identical composer, one or 
    more identical genres and/or identical album). The similarity of titles is 
    assessed after all selected find/replace, reordered word subset and/or edit 
    distance operations are performed, but no such operations are applied to any 
    other fields for the purposes of this report. Each cluster of similar titles 
    where one or more candidate duplicates were filtered out is listed, and each 
    such listing includes either one or two tables. The first table, which is 
    always present, lists recordings that were not found to be duplicates of any 
    other recordings in the cluster. The second table lists all recordings in 
    the cluster, if any, that were in fact found to be duplicates of one or more 
    other recordings in the cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6) Summaries of Probable Errors in Metadata</strong></p>
<p>The reports referred to in this section indicate probable metadata errors that 
  have been found. These can then be used to correct the metadata using software 
  such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target=top>Apple iTunes</a>. 
  jMusicMetaManager errs on the side of reporting false errors rather than missing 
  true errors, so some clusters may not in fact be true errors.</p>
<p>The reports listed here indicate two main types of problems: redundant duplicate 
  recordings and metadata fields that should likely be the same but are not. The 
  reports in this section report clusters of recordings that likely should be 
  corrected. In some cases, overly large clusters are collected. These large clusters 
  can either be ignored or the analysis parameters can be adjusted on the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
  side of the Options Panel</a> so that thresholds are less permissive.</p>
<p>The specific options in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Report probable duplicates of the same recording: </strong>Whether 
    or not the <em>Probable duplicates of the same recording</em> report is generated. 
    This report lists recordings that are likely to be redundant duplicates of 
    the same recording. First, all recordings whose title fields are judged to 
    be similar after any selected find/replace, reordered word subset and edit 
    distance processing are grouped together into clusters. Then the filters selected 
    in the <em>Duplicate Recording Detection Settings</em> section of the <a href="options_panel_processing.html">left 
    side of the Options Panel</a> are applied to each such cluster. Specifically, 
    recordings are filtered out of each cluster unless they have similar durations, 
    have the same value for their artist fields, have the same value for their 
    composer fields, share at least one genre and/or have different values for their 
    album fields. Note that no processing is performed on artist, composer, genre 
    or album fields as far as the generation of this report itself is concerned. 
    Each cluster may be broken into further clusters during this processing, if 
    appropriate. Each cluster with more than one surviving recording is then reported. 
    It may be appropriate to delete some of these multiples for the sake of removing 
    redundancy in the music collection. Note that some false errors may be reported 
    here, as the system is biased under the default settings towards catching 
    all true errors. Large clusters of false errors sometimes form when processing 
    extremely large collections. Such clusters may be ignored by the user, or

  <li><strong>Report probable errors in title field: </strong>Whether or not the 
    <em>Probable errors in title field</em> report is generated. This report lists 
    probable errors in the title field of the input music database's metadata. 
    Each cluster listed indicates a set of several differing yet similar values 
    for the title field that are found in the music database. The values found 
    in each cluster should likely, in reality, be the same. These possible errors 
    should be reviewed and, if appropriate, the metadata should be corrected accordingly. 
    Some clusters may have one or more entries that should not in fact be the 
    same as the others. This is a result of processing that generally errs on 
    the side of reporting false errors rather than missing true errors. Some of 
    the possible transformations that could make them the same are also listed. 
    Only a subset of the necessary find/replace operations may be listed. Additional 
    metadata for each recording in each cluster is also listed. Probable errors 
    reported here were all discovered as a result of the find/replace, reordered 
    word subset and/or edit distance processing that was selected and performed.
