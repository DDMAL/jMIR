	/**
	 * Populates the given buffer with synthesized sound samples using the given
	 * <code>AudioFormat</code>. Alternatively, returns the sample values in the form
	 * of a 2-D array of doubles if the <i>buffer</i> parameter is  null. If the
	 * <i>buffer</i> parameter is not null, then null is returned and the <i>buffer</i>
	 * is filled.
	 *
	 * Uses the provided synthesis type, overall gain, panning and (sometimes) fudamental
	 * to synthesize the audiofrequency.
	 *
	 * <p>The size of the <i>buffer</i> parameter along with the <code>AudioFormat</code>
	 * used determines the duration of the sound to be generated if the <i>buffer</i>
	 * parameter is not null. It is otherwise determined by the <i>duration</i> parameter.
	 *
	 * @param	buffer					The buffer of bytes to write synthesized samples to.
	 *                                  May be null if prefer samples as a 2-D array of
	 *                                  doubles rather than an array of bytes.
	 * @param	duration				The time in seconds to generate. Is ignored if
	 *                                  the <i>buffer</i> parameter is not null.
	 * @param	audio_format			The <code>AudioFormat</code> to use for encoding
	 *									samples to the <i>buffer</i> parameter. Only
	 *									audio_formats consisting of bit depths of 8
	 *									or 16 bits are accepted, and encoding must consist
	 *									of big endian signed PCM samples.
	 * @param	synthesis_type			The code indicating what type of synthesis is to
	 *									be used to fill the  <i>buffer</i> parameter. These
	 *									codes can be accessed using the
	 *									<code>getSynthesisTypeCode</code> method.
	 * @param	gain					The overall loudness of the samples.
	 *									This value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, with
	 *									0.0 being silence and 1.0 being maximum amplitude.
	 * @param	panning					The relative strength of the two stereo channels.
	 *									This parameter is ignored in non-stereo cases.
	 *									Value must be between -1.0 and +1.0, with -1.0
	 *									corresponding to full amplitude on the left
	 *									channel and silence on the right, and +1.0
	 *									corresponding to the reverse. A value of 0
	 *									indicates equal balance.
	 * @param	fundamental_frequency	The fundamental frequency of the sound to be
	 *									synthesiszed. Is ignored for some types of
	 *									synthesis.
	 * @param	max_frac_samp_rate		Used to determine the maximum allowable frequency
	 *									partial that will be permitted to be synthesized.
	 *									This is to avoid aliasing, and generally a value
	 *									of 0.45 is best, with values below 0.5 always
	 *									needed to ensure protection against aliasing.
	 *									The maximum allowable frequency is determined
	 *									by multiplying this value by the sampling rate
	 *									contained in the <i>audio_format</i> paramter.
	 * @param	click_avoid_env_length	The duration in seconds of an envelope applied
	 *                                  at the beginning and end of the synthesized audio
	 *									in order to avoid clicks. Linear attenuation is
	 *									used for this amount of time on each end.
	 * @return							If the <i>buffer</i> parameter is not null, then
	 *									null is returned. If the <i>buffer</i> parameter
	 *									is null, then something is returned:
	 *									A 2-D array of doubles whose first indice
	 *									indicates channel and whose second indice
	 *									indicates sample value. In stereo, indice
	 *									0 corresponds to left and 1 to right. All
	 *									samples should fall between -1 and +1.
	 * @throws	Exception				Throws an informative exception if an invalid
	 *									parameter is specified.
