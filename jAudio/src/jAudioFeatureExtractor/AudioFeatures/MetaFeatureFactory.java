 * This class combines 2 sets of functionality:

 * <li>Instance of this particular metafeature</li>

 * This class is used in the following manner:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create an instance of the class
 * <li>Set dependant MetaFeatureFactory class
 * <li>Cycle over features, generating 1 instance per feature
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: Subclasses of this type must correctly set the three protected
 * classes required by FeatureExtractor in the defineFeature method <b>before</b>
 * returning an instance.
