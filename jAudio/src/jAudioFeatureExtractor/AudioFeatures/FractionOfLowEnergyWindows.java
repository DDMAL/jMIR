/**
 * A feature extractor that extracts the Fraction Of Low Energy Windows from
 * window to window. This is a good measure of how much of a signal is quiet
 * relative to the rest of a signal. <pThis is calculated by taking the mean of
 * the RMS of the last 100 windows and finding what fraction of these 100
 * windows are below the mean.
 * <p>
 * No extracted feature values are stored in objects of this class.
 * <p>
 * Daniel McEnnis 05-07-05 added number_of_windows as editable property. Added
 * getElement, setElement, and clone
 * <p>
 * Daniel McEnnis 05-08-05 added setWindow to permit this feature to be edited
 * by GlobalWindow frame.
