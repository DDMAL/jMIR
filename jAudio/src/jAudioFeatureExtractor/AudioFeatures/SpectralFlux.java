/**
 * A feature extractor that extracts the Spectral Flux from a window of samples and
 * the preceeding window. This is a good measure of the amount of spectral chagne
 * of a signal.
 *
 * <p>Spectral flux is calculated by first calculating the difference between
 * the current value of each magnitude spectrum bin in the current window from
 * the corresponding value of the magnitude spectrum of the previous window.
 * Each of these differences is then squared, and the result is the sum of the
 * squares.
 *
 * <p>No extracted feature values are stored in objects of this class.
