/**
 * A feature extractor that extracts the FFT power spectrum from a set of
 * samples. This is a good measure of the power of different frequency
 * components within a window.
 *
 * <p>The power spectrum is found by first calculating the FFT with a Hanning
 * window. The magnitude spectrum value for each bin is found by first summing
 * the squares of the real and imaginary components. The result is divided by
 * the number of bins.
 *
 * <p>The dimensions of this feature depend on the number of FFT bins, which
 * depend on the number of input samples. The dimensions are stored in the
 * definition field are therefore 0, in order to indicate this variability.
 *
 * <p>No extracted feature values are stored in objects of this class.
